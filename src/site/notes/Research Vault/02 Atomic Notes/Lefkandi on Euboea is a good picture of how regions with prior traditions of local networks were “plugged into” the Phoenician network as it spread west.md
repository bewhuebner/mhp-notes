“Between the Levant and Iberia, the regions first drawn into the web were ones where a prior tradition of indigenous networks and wider engagement was most easily tapped: mainly the Aegean and Tyrrhenian, with the latter’s superior access to trans-Mediterranean routes, and the spectrum of Tuscan and Sardinian metals, gradually relegating its Adriatic neighbour to a self-contained internal circuit. Among tracers of this, at Huelva, Carthage, on Sardinia, mainland Italy and Sicily, were a few Aegean pots, still targeting their modest, if distinctive, niche of the fancily painted drinking or serving vessel. Such cups and plates, often swathed in concentric semicircles, also appeared in the east, mainly around Tyre but at smaller places too, like Al-Mina, as well as on Cyprus. The focus of this style was the large offshore island of Euboea, part of a dense intra-Aegean circuit extending to Macedonia, the Cyclades and the Anatolian coast. Here lay Lefkandi, since the late 11th century BCE an attractor of Levantine goods and, from the 10th century, boasting a gigantically elongated hall swiftly converted into a prominent funeral mound, in the shafts beneath which were interred a cremation with warrior gear and the gold-bedecked body of a woman, both accompanied by slightly battered eastern antiques, plus four slaughtered horses.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 500](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=467&annotation=88UXLI7J))
