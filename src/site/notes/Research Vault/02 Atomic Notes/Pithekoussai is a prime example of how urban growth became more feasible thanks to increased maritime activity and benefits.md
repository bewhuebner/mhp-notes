“The final pathway towards urbanism was that taken by [[Pithekoussai\|Pithekoussai]], with people from far and wide aggregating, often rapidly, at niches and nodes newly favoured by networks of production and trade, a route that the case of Corinth demonstrates might overlap with the previous one. Its ancestry goes back to the growth of island trading villages since the 3rd millennium BCE, and to the boom towns of Hyksos Avaris in the Nile Delta and Enkomi on Cyprus. What made the Iron Age outcome so different was the rise in absolute population and the number of individuals (elite, sub-elite, artisan and, crucially, people engaged in agricultural production as well as trade) in different parts of the basin who were now able to contemplate at least semi-permanent relocation, thanks to enhanced conditions for the maritime movement of people, bulk foods, cash crops and, in fortunate cases, bullion. Over time this created a voluntary equivalent at sea to the overland deportations in the east under empire, and must have equally blurred the Mediterranean’s gene pool. One rough estimate suggests that the departure of a few hundred men each year led a total of 20,000-40,000 leaving the Aegean over the course of the later 8th and 7th centuries BCE, maybe 2-3 per cent of all adult males and a far higher percentage in seagoing regions.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 522-23](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=489&annotation=S4IVBNGR))
