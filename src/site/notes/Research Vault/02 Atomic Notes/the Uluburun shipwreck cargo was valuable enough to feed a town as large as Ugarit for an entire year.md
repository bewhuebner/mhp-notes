“The cargo, carefully packed between dense thorny plants to prevent shifting, is even more extraordinary. One or more people sustained a major blow with its loss, for the value of bulk elements alone has been calculated from prices in contemporary archives to have been enough to feed a town as large as Ugarit for a year. It bears out the [[Mit Rahina inscription\|Mit Rahina inscription]]’s implication that shipments were made up from a wide variety of goods, a breadth that must in part have reflected uncertainties concerning precise destinations, as well as local supply and demand, in as navigationally and economically changeable an environment as the Mediterranean. On the Uluburun ship’s final journey the main cargo consisted of 10 tonnes of Cypriot copper, mainly in the form of 348 oxhide ingots (a larger copper consignment than any in the Amarna letters), a tonne of tin ingots (reflecting the ideal 10:1 alloying ratio for bronze), 150 Levantine Canaanite jars, most holding half a tonne of terebinth resin and the others probably oil, 350 kg (770 lbs) of Egyptian blue glass ingots, and, often overlooked, an unknown original number of textiles, of which only tantalizing purple and red threads remain. On these piggy backed smaller, still often valuable, amounts of many other raw materials and objects, including elephant and hippopotamus tusks and carved ivories, Sudanese blackwood, ostrich eggs, gold, silver and tin both as objects and scraps for recycling, a gold masked bronze goddess (the ship’s protecting deity?), bronze tools and a few weapons of Levantine, Aegean and central Mediterranean types, Cypriot storage pithoi (several holding Cypriot juglets, bowls and lamps, but at least one probably a water-butt), a few Aegean pots (mainly stirrup jars), faience ritual vessels, the thousands of beads, some of Baltic amber, a stone ceremonial axe from the Danube, several musical instruments (a tortoiseshell lyre, bronze finger cymbals and an ivory trumpet), basketry, matting and rope, plants for food, flavouring or sweetening such as olives, grapes, almonds, figs, pomegranates, coriander, capers and safflower, orpiment for tanning or dyeing, murex opercula (which played no part in dyeing, but was possibly a medical ingredient), bone gaming pieces, and fishing gear. Last but not least comes the apparatus of mobile trade, 149 balance weights divided into sets for several different standards prevalent around the Levant and east Mediterranean, cylinder seals and scarabs, and, stored in a pithos, a little folding wooden writing board, onto whose waxed surface no one had sadly yet inscribed.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 401](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=377&annotation=JAMNWA2L)) [[Encyclopedia/06 Ships/Uluburun shipwreck\|Uluburun shipwreck]]

“The [[Encyclopedia/06 Ships/Uluburun shipwreck\|Uluburun shipwreck]] is the trading world of the east Mediterranean both in microcosm, as a moment of simultaneous conveyance, and in its widest ramifications, with the objects brought together in those few cubic metres of shipboard space originating as far apart as Afghanistan, Sudan, the Baltic and the central Mediterranean.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 402](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=378&annotation=EKSAHNVE)) #USE in [[Maritime History Podcast/01 Episode Transcripts/Series 1 - The Bronze Age/(OLD) 016 - Old Money - The Uluburun and Gelidonya Wrecks\|(OLD) 016 - Old Money - The Uluburun and Gelidonya Wrecks]]

“The wreck’s westerly position suggests that it had subsequently either been blown badly off course, or was heading towards the Aegean, an unusual event from Ugarit’s archival perspective, with the few Aegean pots homeward-bound after circulating further east. If the latter destination holds good, this was again an important shipment, because the amount of copper on board is greater than that listed in all Aegean archives. Some would push the inferences further, using the cedar construction and best candidates for crew possessions (seals, weights, weapons and possible galley crockery) to argue for a Levantine home port and Levantine plus, more dubiously, Aegean merchants on board. This is not intrinsically unlikely, but a Cypriot origin is equally possible and, as the father of modern Mediterranean underwater archaeology and initial excavator of Uluburun memorably put it, how would we define the home of a modern ship ‘built in Japan but flying a Panamanian flag with a Portuguese captain and a Filipino crew.. .carrying Swedish automobiles and French wine to Brazil’? Furthermore, we have no idea whether the ship sailed alone or in company. Its feeble armament could imply that it had an escort, and we know Egyptian ships laden with rich cargos tended to move in convoy, often with a troop of archers on board – but conversely, recall Sinaranu of Ugarit’s solitary ship reportedly on its way back from the Aegean.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 402](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=378&annotation=Z36HIGB5))
