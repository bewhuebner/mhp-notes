“Shell-built with planks carved from logs at least 7 meters long, the Khufu I ship represents a tremendous investment of labor and capital. Its builders cut several thousand V-shaped channels in rows across the inside of the hull and threaded more than a mile of rope in and out of the holes. On deck, a collapsible deckhouse and canopy constructed from prefabricated cedar panels provided shelter from the elements.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=54&annotation=7TBV76DU))
