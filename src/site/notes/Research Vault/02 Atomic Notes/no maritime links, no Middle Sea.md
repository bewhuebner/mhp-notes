“Such terrestrial distances would have impressed a 2nd-millennium BCE merchant, and although in the interim there were major changes (downward as well as upward) in the regularity of long-range transfers, a surge in volumes on the move with the coming of pack animals, and land routes that proved resilient to competition from the sea, overland connections would necessarily play second fiddle to maritime ones in terms of defining a marine basin as a theatre of interaction. ==To reiterate: no maritime links, no Middle Sea.==” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 596](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=554&annotation=APTM447P))

The entire globe is today far more united as between its constituent parts than the Mediterranean was in the age of Pericles.
