“In eleven of the Amarna letters, the leaders of the great powers wrote to the pharaoh to request “much gold.” They almost all did it—Tushratta of Mittani, Kadashman-Enlil I and then Burna-buriash II of Babylonia, Ashur-uballit of Assyria, and even a Hittite prince. Why did they want all this gold? It was always for a good reason, they protested. Vital building projects were in the works, and gold was simply essential. In one letter, Burna-buriash II of Babylonia virtually demanded gold for a temple that he was building: “At the moment my work on a temple is extensive, and I am quite busy with carrying it out. Send me much gold.”” ([Podany, 2012, p. 247](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=272&annotation=JXCCHWLB))

“The Egyptian kings seem rarely if ever to have satisfied their allies’ desire for gold for their building projects.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 249](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=274&annotation=ZFYSLGPK))
