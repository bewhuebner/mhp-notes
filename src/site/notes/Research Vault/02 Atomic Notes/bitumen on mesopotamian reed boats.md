“Some of the most exciting finds from H3 consist of reed impressed bitumen slabs and fragments, many of which bear barnacles on one side. These are interpreted as the remains of bitumen-coated reed-bundled seafaring boats or ships (see below).” ([Carter, 2014, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=8&annotation=6QBP7Z73))

“Another interpretation is that the pieces represent the remains of other bitumen-coated reed-bundle structures whose function involves submersion, e.g. fish-traps or fresh-water containers to be towed behind boats.” ([Carter, 2014, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=9&annotation=QXSIPAQ2))

“Comparable material from Ra’s al-Jinz (see below) was found to have probably originated from northern Iraq, or less likely from Luristan (Cleuziou & Tosi 1994: 756), but this is not directly relevant to the H3 finds. Bitumen seeps are reported in Kuwait, near Burgan (Potts 1995: 563), while reeds are reported to have grown within living memory in the Sabiyah area.” ([Carter, 2014, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=9&annotation=FS5PSAVI))

“The clearest parallels for the H3 pieces are with fragments of bitumen from Ras al-Jinz (RJ-2), Oman, dating to the second half of the 3rd millennium B.C., some three millennia later than the H3 examples” ([Carter, 2014, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=9&annotation=9RECWVG5))

“There can be no doubt that the Ra’s al-Jinz bitumen represents the coating of Bronze Age ships. Some of these may have been entirely of reed construction, with others of reed and stitched-plank construction; Cleuziou & Tosi suggest that evolution from one variety to the other is evident within the Ras al-Jinz bitumen, the change occurring at around 2300 B.C. (1997: 69).” ([Carter, 2014, p. 99](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=10&annotation=4WKYJLJV))

“Both the H3 model and the bitumen pieces indicate a vessel type which falls into McGrail’s class of reed boat, defined as “bound bundles of reed lashed together (coiled basketry) to produce a hollow form, and waterproofed with bitumen” (1984: 290). He states that the hollow form would be strengthened with a light framework, and places the type in class C12 “skeleton-built with waterproof envelope made by transformations” (1984: 290, 298). We have no evidence as to whether there was or was not an inner framework in the H3 vessels, but wood would not necessarily be required to make one: tightly lashed reed bundles running inside the hull at right angles to the main bundles may have sufficed.” ([Carter, 2014, p. 99](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=10&annotation=QEIFDNAA))


==“Apart from the glyptic evidence mentioned above, and the archaeological evidence of bitumen-covered reedbundle ships from Ras al-Jinz, there is also textual evidence that such vessels were in use by the Bronze Age. An Ur III text from Girsu gives a list of boat-building materials which includes vast quantities of reeds, and bitumen “for the coating of Magan type boat”, while another Ur III text details 900 kg of bitumen stripped from a boat (Cleuziou & Tosi 1994: 746, 754).”== ([Carter, 2014, p. 99](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=10&annotation=ZMEDBB9B))

==“Similar techniques were used until the last century in the marshes of southern Iraq: [[Thesiger, WIlfred\|Thesiger]] describes how the Marsh Arabs coated their boats with bitumen from Hit, near Baghdad (1994: 113). In the case of wooden ‘canoes’, the old coating was chipped off, and new melted bitumen was applied over the upturned boat with a roller (Thesiger 1994: Pl. 48, 49). The coating was said not to last over a year, and to be a quarter of an inch thick (Thesiger 1994: 112-113). During the 19th century, bitumen-coated reed boats known as tarada were used in the marshes, though by Thesiger’s time these appear to have been made with wood. Instead, he describes smaller vessels made of reed bundles ([[zaima\|zaima]]). These were coated externally with bitumen, but Thesiger’s source stated that such craft could only be used for one year, as the bitumen coating could not be renewed==(Thesiger 1994: 114, Pl. 16).” ([Carter, 2014, p. 99](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=10&annotation=W4GVX26G))
