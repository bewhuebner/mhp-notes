On the other side were a motley group of those who, for various reasons, did not like what Caesar was up to or the powers he seemed to be seeking. for A few were probably as highly principled as they were unrealistic; as [[Cicero\|Cicero]] once said of Cato, ‘he talks as if he were in the Republic of Plato, when in fact he is in the crap of Romulus’. But it was only later, in the romantic nostalgia under the early emperors, that they were reinvented en bloc as fully fledged freedom fighters and martyrs united in the struggle against autocracy. The irony was that [[Pompey\|Pompey]], their figurehead, was no less an autocrat than Caesar.

What came to be seen as a war between liberty and one-man rule was really a war to choose between rival emperors.
