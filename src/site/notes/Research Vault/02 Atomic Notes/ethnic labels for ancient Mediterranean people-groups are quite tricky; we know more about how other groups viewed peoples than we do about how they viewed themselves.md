“So far, this book has deliberately eschewed writing about Mediterranean people in such terms, avoiding ‘Greek’ and ‘Etruscan’ save as languages and casting doubt on ‘Phoenician’ unity. One reason for caution is the fact that we simply do not know how the millions of people spread over the basin across the millennia identified themselves in collective terms, beyond the pharaonic vision of Egypt, the categories Egypt projected onto its neighbours, and a few loose groupings that the latter recognized in themselves, such as ‘Canaanite’. Another is the suspicion that, while ethnicities based on real or fictive descent, cohabitation or language surely must have coalesced under some conditions, these and other forms of identity were fluid and unassertive compared to those forged in later times, and radically different again, in geographical scope and constituent elements, from those trumpeted, for good or evil, in recent years.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 532](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=498&annotation=YR52V5VA))
