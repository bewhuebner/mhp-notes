“In a clearly premeditated early 6th-century example, people from Phocaea, a seagoing city-state in the east Aegean, set out to outflank Tyrrhenian traffic by instigating trading places at Marseilles (to which we shall return) and Alalia, on the Corsican coast directly facing Elba and its iron sources. Their retreat from the latter, after a close-fought engagement with Etruscan and Carthaginian ships, marked in essence the defeat of one aspiring network hub by its rivals. To underscore the fact that location still mattered at least as much as ethnicity, consider the defeat in 510 BCE of Greek Sybaris, grown notoriously rich thanks to its isthmian position, where a donkey trail across Calabria to Poseidonia (Paestum), and thence on to its Etruscan trading partners short-circuited the sea-route around the Italian toe. The equally Greek assailant was the thereby bypassed town of Croton, which followed up its victory with exceptional, Babylonian-style savagery. Sybaris was wiped out, and the local river diverted to smother its site forever.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 550-51](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=517&annotation=KW6K6A47))
