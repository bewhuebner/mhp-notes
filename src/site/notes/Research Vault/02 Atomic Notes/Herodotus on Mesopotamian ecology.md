Now the land of the Assyrians has but little rain; and this little gives nourishment to the root of the grain, but the crop is ripened and the ear comes on by the help of irrigation, not as in Egypt by the coming up of the river itself over the fields, but the crop is watered by hand or with swing-buckets. For the whole Babylonian territory like the Egyptian is cut up into channels, and the largest channels is navigable for ships and runs south-easterly in winter from the Euphrates to another river, namely the Tigris. - [[Herodotus\|Herodotus]], *Histories*, 1:192-200
