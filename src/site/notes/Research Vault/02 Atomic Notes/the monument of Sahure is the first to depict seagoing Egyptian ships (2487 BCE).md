“Trade by sea is mentioned on the so-called Palermo Stone, but the funerary monuments of Sahure (2487-2475 BCE) and Unas (2375-2345 BCE) are the first to illustrate the vessels involved. They depict solid, seagoing ships with bipod or tripod masts, long oars for manoeuvring or ancillary travel, a truss from stem to stern holding the ship together (another relic of reed-built techniques), heavy stone anchors, a mixture of stereotypical Egyptians and Levantine people, the latter including children and so probably captives rather than emissaries or crew, all performing onboard obeisance to pharaoh, plus a cargo of jugs and, less predictably, bears, the last a reminder of the kinds of exotics that we tend to forget. The sail was supported by a yard above and boom below, as would remain standard for a thousand years. This rig, and the stepping of the mast further back, may have allowed headway as much as 30 degrees off the wind. In combination with some tacking or jibing ability, the on- and offshore coastal breezes and, as a last resort, the leverage of long oars, this permitted progress up the Levantine coast even against prevailing winds. The overwhelming impression is of the sheer scale of these machines, their complexity and the intricacies of wood, linen, rope, joinery and rigging, handling know-how, and even the bodily discipline of rowing backwards. In later times they could still cost a fortune; in 2nd-millennium Egypt a tall mainmast alone, typically 16 m (52 ft) high, was priced similarly to a slave. All this argues that the first sailing ships represented an acme of state-level endeavour. For now, the image of one such prototype nudging free of the last mud-shoals and reed-banks into the choppy, still silt-stained waters of the open sea offers as evocative a symbol as one could desire of the changing face of the Mediterranean.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 291-92](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=268&annotation=JX5V57S6))
