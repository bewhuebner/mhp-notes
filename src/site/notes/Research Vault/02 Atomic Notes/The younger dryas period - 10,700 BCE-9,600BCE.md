“The Younger Dryas itself was triggered, in an illustration of the paradoxical feedbacks in the world’s climate system, by icy meltwaters from the shrinking North American ice sheets spewing into the north Atlantic, where they shut down the conveyor currents of warm water and precipitated an abrupt return to cold, dry times. It was harshly felt across the Mediterranean, and in parts of the Aegean and Levant may have brought even worse aridity than the Last Glacial Maximum. The advance of the trees halted and was then reversed. Sea level rise petered out globally, and Lake Lisan dropped by some 200 m (650 ft) to below the level of the Dead Sea today.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 146](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=134&annotation=6THWH4JS)
