“Killen suggests that although cedar can be knotty and has a very pronounced grain pattern, it was preferred by the Egyptians because its softness allowed their copper tools to be more effective. Egyptians also appreciated the fragrance and rot resistance of cedar and related these characteristics to religious concerns; durability is a prime practical concern for shipwrights.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=29&annotation=BKQGMQMF))
