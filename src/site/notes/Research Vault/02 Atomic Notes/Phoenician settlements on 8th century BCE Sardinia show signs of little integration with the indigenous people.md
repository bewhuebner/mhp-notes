“Earlier, during the 8th century, another rash of small Phoenician settlements had taken hold further to the east, on the offshore islets and slender headlands around southern and western Sardinia, building upon 9th-century BCE engagements. These all faced resolutely seaward, whether due to the fractious and resistive propensities of nuragic societies, the availability of quality ores near the coast, or a greater focus on tapping into the sea trade in metals from Sardinia via Elba to Etruria than on agricultural exports. Little effort was made to engage local Sardinians and there are potential signs of conflict, including abandoned nuraghi in their vicinity, and a quickly established fort at Sulcis on the modern headland (then an offshore island) of Sant’Antioco. The gold jewels, scarabs and seals later crafted at Tharros, for example, spread far across the sea but barely registered inland, where the eastern-type goods so popular elsewhere remained uncommon.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 527](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=493&annotation=JEPF8RHF))
