“Under the Old Kingdom contacts intensified by sea, following the inception of a minor maritime route in the late 4th millennium BCE. In particular, the central Levantine coast, now northern Israel and Lebanon, was targeted for bulk imports of cedar, whose use, in a classic illustration of sky-rocketing consumer demand, had spread to coffins, architecture and watercraft in Egypt (the superbly preserved 26th-century BCE, 43-m- (141-ft-) long royal barge of Khufu, or Cheops, he of the Great Pyramid, used 12 tonnes of cedar, with the shortest single hull plank 7 m (23 ft) long and 12 cm (almost 5 in.) thick). Alongside this and other fragrant woods went oils and resins, Anatolian metals, rare stones, including a second pulse of lapis lazuli, and other goods. There was a clear logic to this shift. As Egypt established direct control over the Sinai mines, the need to obtain copper from presumably locally contested south Levantine sources evaporated, much as the inception of a home wine industry reduced, at least temporarily, the need for substantial imports. Attention switched to materials and substances that were only accessible further to the north.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 287-88](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=264&annotation=AKYMZP3R))
