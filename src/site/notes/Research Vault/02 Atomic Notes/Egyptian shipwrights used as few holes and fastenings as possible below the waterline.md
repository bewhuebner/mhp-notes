“The overwhelming impression gained from studying the Khufu I hull is that shipwrights left the wood in the hull bottom alone as much as possible. Their experience may have taught them that increasing the number of fastenings there increased potential sources for leaks or that seating the first strake on top of the bottom planking and then rabbeting the midships area made use of the hull's weight and geometry and was sufficient to keep it together. Mortise-and-tenon fastenings in transverse lines and the transverse lashings of the hull played important roles in the finished vessel. Using these techniques minimized the need to put holes in or otherwise weaken the bottom planking. The hull's shape, construction, and fastening systems appear to hold the bottom together in ways both daring and foreign to modern boat-building and naval architectural standards.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 52](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=60&annotation=34FLBP5Q))
