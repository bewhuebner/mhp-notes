“Sailors on a boat traveling north from Egypt to the wealthy port cities of Syria might have seen the hills of Alashiya off to the west, just fifty-seven miles from the coast. Part of the Alashiyan king’s cockiness might have come from his conviction that the king of Egypt wouldn’t stand a chance of adding Alashiya to his empire. The pharaoh had no navy, and his fighters were accustomed to battles in chariots, not boats.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 253](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=278&annotation=6S5P5NMV))

“We’re left with a bit of a mystery surrounding this unnamed king. Alashiya was just an island state, not an empire like Egypt, Mittani, or Hatti or a major kingdom like Babylonia. The pharaoh doesn’t seem to have objected to being called “brother” by the king of Alashiya, but this man was not a member of the great king brotherhood. In some ways, he seems to have been a bit of a loose cannon: unfriendly, accusatory, but then promptly conciliatory as well, and surprisingly uninformed on the luxury goods available in the home of his ally.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 255](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=280&annotation=VW8VGKWL))
