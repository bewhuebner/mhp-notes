“Along all these interfaces between the Mediterranean and lands beyond, much of the pace was initially made by people north of palatial Crete, especially those well placed at the convergence of land and sea-routes in the lively corner of the Peloponnese dominated by Mycenae. Indeed, the wider significance of Mycenaean societies lay less in their eventual swelling by a few modest examples of an already time-honoured roster of palatial states, than in their articulation of the core zone of palaces with non-palatial societies and materials further west and north. Only in the Aegean did chariot-horse harness designs typical of the Levant, Europe and Black Sea all coexist, and there, too, millet, another product of the Russian steppe, first percolated into the basin as a fodder crop. Only there could objects as exuberantly eclectic as those in Mycenae’s shaft graves have been found together; among them, a spearhead with its socket cast in the round is the first Mediterranean find of a feature invented between the Urals and Altai, and brought west by pastoralists into southeast Europe. It was this interstitial role that gave Mycenaean culture its peculiar flavour, a blend of half-grasped Minoan traditions, eastern palatial tastes and values, temperate European heroic warrior ideals, and an occasional tang of the Asian steppes. Another rising power, at Troy, played a similar role in regard to Aegean links with the Black Sea, and this provides a likely context for two poorly dated ships drawn on the walls of the Yarimburgaz cave near the Sea of Marmara, one showing a slender rowed or paddled craft, the other a jaunty sailing ship.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 432](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=408&annotation=6BMZ6AT8))

“But equally, we should not exaggerate, nor anticipate, the importance of such connections at this early juncture. Not until the Iron Age did relations become close enough to fundamentally reshape the culture and economies of outlying regions. With a few exceptions in southern Italy, no defining elements of east Mediterranean ways of life and capital-accumulating economies yet took root further afield.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 441](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=409&annotation=VJ6E5E8P))

“In the final assessment, the vital point, as ever, was that maritime travel facilitated direct, unmediated, long-range links between places far apart, and so less-garbled transmission and dialogue than overland chains of communication.” (Broodbank, 2013, p. 442-43) (pdf)
