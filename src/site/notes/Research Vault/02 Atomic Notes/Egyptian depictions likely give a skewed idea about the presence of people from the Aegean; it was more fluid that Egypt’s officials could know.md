“Fragments of a papyrus from Amarna depicting soldiers in vaguely Aegean gear may imply that this practice began slightly earlier, but it certainly took off in the 13th century BCE. Royal texts and images stereotyped such people with attributes and labels, a few of which will reappear in different contexts later in this chapter, notably the ‘Shardana’, shown with horned helmets and effective-looking swords, who served as pharaoh’s bodyguard, fought at Qadesh and by the 12th century BCE were renting land in small groups of ten to twenty in the Fayum and further south. In reality, the population element from the wider Mediterranean was probably a very fluid amalgam of mercenaries, traders and other characters of more varying backgrounds than Egyptian officialdom was able to discern or ready to admit. The picture of Tanis in Wenamun’s day, with its multitude of foreign ships coming and going, argues that this permeability survived the broader changes around it.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 456](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=423&annotation=9MRU4W5B))
