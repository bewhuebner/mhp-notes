An early 7th-century BCE pot from Caere in Etruria illustrates in simplified form, and at a moment of high tension, the two basic kinds of craft at sea – with a familiar scene of Cyclops-blinding on the reverse. Cargo ships remained round-hulled, sail-driven craft with auxiliary oars, probably already known by their later nickname as ‘tubs’. “Meanwhile, in the east, the Aegean and maybe further west, slender, oared galleys grew into skinny craft 20 m (65 ft) or so long, with up to fifty rowers (hence pentekonters in Greek), some of a two-tiered, or bireme, design. Galleys bifurcated in functional terms, too, into those designed primarily for low-to-medium-volume trade, and custom-built warships with a ram mounted on the prow and space for soldiers. Rams signalled the start of sea-battles of ship-on-ship manoeuvre as well as boarding, and the first true naval flotillas. At first these were tiny – in the 720s a mere dozen state-of-the-art Tyrian warships fought off a fleet commandeered by Assyria – and largely made up of ships in private hands, not least at Corinth, the leading Aegean maritime polity by the 7th century, which clashed at sea with its former outpost on Corfu between 680 and 644 BCE. As galley complements grew, drinking water requirements began to tether such craft more than their antecedents to coastal areas and quick open-sea sprints, though this still brought most of the east and central Mediterranean into range. More than sailing ships, it was such galleys passing swiftly along the coasts and between islands during the summer months that would circulate hundreds of footloose young men - traders, fighters or both - over long distances, bringing these micro-populations in contact with often initially quite different shore-dwellers.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 514](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=480&annotation=2ZFDX28U))
