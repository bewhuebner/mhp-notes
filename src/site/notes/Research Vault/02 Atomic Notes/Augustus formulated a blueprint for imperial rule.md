Augustus’ power, as he formulates it, is signalled by military conquest, by his role of protector and benefactor of the people in Rome and by construction and reconstruction on a vast scale; and it was underpinned by massive reserves of cash, combined with the display of respect for the ancient traditions of Rome. It was against this blueprint that every emperor for the next 200 years was judged. ([Location 5209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0108U7IHO&location=5209)) (page 366)

In other words, after hundreds of years of a semi-public, semi-private militia, Augustus fully nationalised the Roman legions and removed them from politics. ([Location 5286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0108U7IHO&location=5286)) (page 371)
