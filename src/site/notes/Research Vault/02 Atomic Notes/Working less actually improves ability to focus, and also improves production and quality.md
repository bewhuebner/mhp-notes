All this suggests that when people work less, their focus significantly improves. Andrew told me we have to take on the logic that more work is always better work. “There’s a time for work, and there’s a time for not having work,” he said, but today, for most people, “the problem is that we don’t have time. Time, and reflection, and a bit of rest to help us make better decisions. So, just by creating that opportunity, the quality of what I do, of what the staff does, improves.” ([Location 2951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093G9TS91&location=2951))

Ask any sports fan, he said. “If I want to win a football game, [or] if I want to win a baseball game, do I really want my team to be exhausted?” He let this question hang in the air. Why, he asked, would the rest of us be any different? ([Location 2959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093G9TS91&location=2959))
