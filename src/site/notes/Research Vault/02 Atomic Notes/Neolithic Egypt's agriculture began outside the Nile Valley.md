“Archaeologists who study the origins of agriculture have learned that people try to control food resources in marginal environments rather than in areas with abundant resources. This is true in Egypt, where the oldest cultivated grain was found at the desert site of Nabta (7000 B.C.) in conjunction with pottery and the bones of domesticated cattle and sheep/goat. Cultivated plants first appear in Nile sites at levels dating to about 5000 B.C. A shift to drier conditions about 5000-4000 B.C. coincided wjth the introduction of agriculture to the Nile Valley and the first Neolithlc sites there.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=14&annotation=WPWHYWIV))
