“it is in this document that we find the word "[[freedom\|freedom]]" used for the first time in man s recorded history; the word is amargi, which, as has recently been pointed out by Adam Falkenstein, means literally "return to the mother." However, we still do not know why this figure of speech came to be used for "freedom."” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 79](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=79&annotation=HT8I2NTU))
