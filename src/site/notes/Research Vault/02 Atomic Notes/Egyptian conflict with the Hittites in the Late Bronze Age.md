“This loss of both Kadesh and Amurru to the Hittites might have driven the pharaoh to react; he could have sent troops to the Levant to fight directly against the Hittites, and a region-wide war of Egyptians, Hittites, and Mittanians might have erupted for control of the Levantine lands. It didn’t happen, though. Perhaps messengers were still passing between Suppiluliuma and Akhenaten, and they were able to avoid an open conflict through diplomatic means.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 279](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=304&annotation=LFYHFM6F))
