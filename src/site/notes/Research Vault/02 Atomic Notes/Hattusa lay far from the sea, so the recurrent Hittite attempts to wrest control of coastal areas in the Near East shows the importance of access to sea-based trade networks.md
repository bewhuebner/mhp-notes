But a further key concern for Hatti, whose hallowed capital Hattusa lay far from the sea and the trunk routes of trade, was assured access to such arteries, to the extent of flirting with an alternative capital further south. This explains a recurrent focus throughout Hatti’s vicissitudes on control over the great Jazira trail through to its Mediterranean terminus at Ugarit, and over Cilicia, known as Kizzuwatna, where the Taurus passes provided its best window on the Mediterranean – a poor second to Egypt’s Delta, but still a funnel up which goods from Egypt, the Levant and Cyprus could reach Hattusa. This gravitation south and seaward by one of the great powers of the day is eloquent testimony to the perceived wealth of the east Mediterranean by this time, and the consequent necessity of access to it.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 405](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=381&annotation=I7FRSHG8))
