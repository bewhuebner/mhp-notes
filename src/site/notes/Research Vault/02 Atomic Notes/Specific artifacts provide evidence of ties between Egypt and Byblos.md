“In the early 3rd millennium BCE, as Egypt’s appetite for the timber in Byblos’s immediate hinterland intensified, a special relationship began to blossom. A late 2nd-Dynasty royal stone bowl has been found there, and from the nearby mouth of the Adonis River (named for a Levantine deity and now the Nahr Ibrahim), which runs blood-red with iron-rich soils each spring, comes the lucky find of an axe engraved with the name of a 4th-Dynasty lumberjack gang or ship’s crew, one of several Egyptian formalized work groups that acquired nautical links. From now on, Byblos appears disproportionately often relative to other Levantine places in Egyptian records, and was accorded a special role in Egyptian cosmology. The very sailing craft that tied this economic, political and sacred knot became known in time as ‘Byblos ships’.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 301](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=278&annotation=H5HHUHAS))
