“Neanderthals were among the first to eat the sea’s products and possibly to travel over its surface; the next chapter reveals that the last of them died on its shores. From its evolutionary beginnings to its final whimper, the history of the Neanderthals, people in many ways our haunting, ultimate ‘other’, is a tale with profoundly Mediterranean twists.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 102](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=99&annotation=CX874A42))

“If (and that qualification should be firmly retained for the present) the island Middle Palaeolithic sites are genuine, and if Neanderthals made the tools (the alternative of otherwise invisible early modern humans is a long stretch), then at least a few such people must have developed limited water-crossing abilities. Use of tree trunks and crude paddles lay within Neanderthals’ woodworking skills, to judge from the remains of trunks, flattened planks and fashioned sticks among the finds at Abric Romani. The fact that all the islands concerned are modest in size would favour brief visits, maybe in response to shifts in local environments and demography, rather than permanent residence. Equally striking is the emphasis on the Greek archipelago, an area whose intricate configuration we drew attention to in Chapter 2, and whose role as a focus of nascent seafaring will be further affirmed in Chapter 5. As with the breadth of foods at Mediterranean Neanderthal sites, such potential relics of short-range seagoing may imply that the basin had begun to fashion behaviour and encourage certain kinds of innovation, despite vast differences between its Pleistocene and later environments. In this narrow sense, Mediterranean societies could have started to come into being from a very early date, and outside our own species.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 108](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=105&annotation=L3B3FIB5)
