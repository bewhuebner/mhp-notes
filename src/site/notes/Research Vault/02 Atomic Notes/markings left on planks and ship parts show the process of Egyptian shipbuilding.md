“Shipwrights marked plank joins and mortises on the Lisht and Dashur hulls with score marks and black painted lines (see Chs. 8 and 10). The most extensive series of marks has been found on the Khufu I ship, but most of the hull signs probably were associated with its anticipated reassembly rather than with its original construction. The clearly marked centerline on the Khufu I vessel is the exception; it probably was used to check hull symmetry.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 29](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=39&annotation=UYWUVXX2))
