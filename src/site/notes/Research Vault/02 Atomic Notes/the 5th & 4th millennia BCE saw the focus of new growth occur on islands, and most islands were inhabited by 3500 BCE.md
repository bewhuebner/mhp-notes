“During the 5th and 4th millennia BCE all this changed. Islands witnessed a greater influx at this time than any other environment in the basin, even if in absolute terms the numbers must have been small, often in the hundreds even once population had built up, and no more than a few families in certain cases. Crossings to Pantelleria testify to people’s abilities to navigate to scraps of land well out to sea, and similar efforts elsewhere in the channel brought the Neolithic package across 80 km (50 miles) from Sicily to Malta before 5000 BCE, as well as pottery, sheep, goats and pigs to Lampedusa. The last of these, at 120 km (75 miles) from other land, must define the remotest community in the Mediterranean, close to the limit to what was attempted by sea at this time.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 212](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=198&annotation=2ELAL3C8))

“Few islands of any substance remained uninhabited after about 3500 BCE. Most that did were extremely small, unusually far from other land, or both; some, indeed, could not sustain life for any length of time, such as the tiny, waterless stopover of Palagruza. During the late 4th and 3rd millennia BCE, the smallest Cyclades would finally be taken in, down to little Delos, as would Ustica, just 50 km (30 miles) north of Palermo but hidden in a sea desert and until then seldom frequented.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 213](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=199&annotation=FGPWCGRY))

“The only really distinguished members of the latecomers’ club are the Balearics. As will be explained in Chapter 7, it is well-nigh certain that these big but remote islands lay empty until the late 3rd millennium BCE, winning the distinction of being the last land masses in the Mediterranean to become peopled, and maybe even to feel the impress of a visiting human foot.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 213](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=199&annotation=GUA456Y4))
