“Ports were an equally key element in such east Mediterranean landscapes or, in this instance, coast-scapes. They might be towns in their own right, but the locally paramount urban palatial settlement usually lay a little distance inland. Some smaller ports arose independently, perhaps run by consortia of sea-trading families, and accumulated a degree of wealth belied by their diminutive size. Byblos, which never grew substantially, already furnished an example of this highly Mediterranean phenomenon in Chapter 7, and we shall encounter others below. Harbour facilities still mainly comprised those offered by nature: bays, coves, the lee of coastal islets or headlands, lagoons and lastly rivers, at their mouth or further upstream. This entailed offshore mooring for large or laden ships, unloading by smaller lighters, and perhaps applications of pitch to hulls to avoid the attentions of marine worms. Faint hints of artificial improvement can be picked up at a few Levantine ports, for instance poorly dated cuttings in a long sandstone ridge at Sidon, a breakwater of boulders at Yavne-Yam, and a reference in the Ugarit archives to a ship colliding with a quay. Sadly, in the Mediterranean nothing has been found to rival Marsa Gawasis, ancient Sawaw, Egypt’s early 2nd-millennium BCE Red Sea port, with its ship timbers, still-coiled ropes, stone anchors, votive shrines, workshops, storerooms and discarded storage chests from the Punt trade. A wall-painting from Akrotiri does, however, afford us one glimpse of an Aegean harbour, set amidst a cluster of coves, in sprinting range of a coastal town, while a later, 14th-century BCE painting from the tomb of Kenamun in upriver Egyptian Thebes shows a quayside scene on the Nile with docked Levantine ships. Both underscore that there was more to ports than their facilities. They were gateways, places of encounter between different people (note the formalized greetings and demarcating dress codes) and knowledge hubs, where news and ideas as much as goods were sought and exchanged. Even though commonly under palatial supervision, not least due to the lucrative harbour dues surely generated by their comings and goings, such melting pots slowly encouraged the rise of personae and practices less susceptible to control by terrestrial authority. The term ‘port power’ nicely summarizes this phenomenon, which would intensify steadily over the millennium.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 357](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=333&annotation=5WS7J8AG))
