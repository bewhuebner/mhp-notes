“Our third window is a porthole 40-50 m (130-165 ft) underwater off the eastern cliffs of the savage Uluburun (‘Great Cape’), which thrusts seaward from the cruel coast of Lycia in southern Turkey. Around 1325 BCE, a little after the latest Amarna correspondence, a heavily laden ship foundered here, and its discovery by local sponge divers followed by a state-of-the-art underwater excavation revealed the world’s earliest well-preserved shipwreck. So far, we have made do with a combination of boat depictions, bills of lading, and bits and pieces recovered from the seabed. In contrast, the 15,000 artifacts (excluding some 85,000 beads) raised at Uluburun are a veritable treasure-house of information. The artifact to begin with is the ship itself, a 15-m (50-ft) vessel, the lower parts of which survive enough to reveal cedar-wood construction, joined without nails by a pegged mortise-and-tenon technique, and painstakingly built up shell-first from the keel (the frame-first method standard today was invented in the late 1st millennium AD). Nothing survives of the mast, rigging and sail, so above the waterline we must mentally splice in the Kenamun or Akrotiri images. The [[Encyclopedia/06 Ships/Uluburun shipwreck\|Uluburun shipwreck]] was carrying at least 20 tonnes of cargo and shipboard gear, including twenty-four stone anchors (3 tonnes-worth) of a kind common in the Levant and occasionally found in the Aegean; this apparent superfluity served as ballast, in addition to a thousand-odd stones carried for this purpose, and enabled mooring on steep coasts, where an anchor could be simply cut away before sailing on.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 399-400](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=375&annotation=VEPZDNL7))

“Trade between the Aegean and central Mediterranean became more extensive, frequent and multidirectional at a point in time that equates further east with the Uluburun shipwreck, Amarna letters and overall peak of the palatial system.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 412](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=412&annotation=GE9TCGTA))
