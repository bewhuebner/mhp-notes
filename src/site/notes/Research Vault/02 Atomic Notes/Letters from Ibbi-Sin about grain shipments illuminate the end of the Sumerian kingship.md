“The text of three letters belonging to this royal correspondence is now available. The first contains a report sent to Ibbi-Sin by Ishbi-Erra on the results of a grain-buying expedition with which Ibbi-Sin had charged him; the letter sheds considerable light on the incursions of the Amorites into western Sumer as well as on the difficulties the Elamites were making for Ibbi-Sin. Ishbi-Erra begins his report with the statement that he succeeded in buying seventy-two thousand gur of grain at the normal price of one shekel per gur; but having heard that the hostile Amorites had entered Sumer and "seized the great fortresses one after the other," he had brought the grain not to Ur the capital but to Isin. If the king would now send him six hundred boats of one hundred twenty gur each, he continues, he will deliver the grain to the various cities of Sumer; however, he should be put in charge "of the places where the boats are to be moored/' The letter closes with a plea to Ibbi-Sin not to give in to the Elamites—presumably, they were actually laying siege to Ur and its environs—for he had enough grain to satisfy the hunger of the "palace and its cities” for fifteen years. In any case, he pleads, the king must put him in charge of both Nippur and Isin. That Ibbi-Sin had great confidence in Ishbi-Erra and actually did entrust Nippur and Isin to him we learn from his letter of reply, which although still unpublished has recently been summarized by Thorkild Jacobsen.” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 70](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=70&annotation=UGRQ8CJH))

“Unfortunately for Ibbi-Sin, Ishbi-Erra turned out to be as disloyal as he was capable and competent; he was successful not only in defending Isin and Nippur but in usurping his master's throne as well. This we learn, of course, not from Ishbi-Erra's correspondence with Ibbi-Sin but from a letter written to the latter by Puzur-Numushda, a governor of the city Kazallu, and Ibbi-Sin\*s reply.” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 71](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=71&annotation=NW2IU9UD))
