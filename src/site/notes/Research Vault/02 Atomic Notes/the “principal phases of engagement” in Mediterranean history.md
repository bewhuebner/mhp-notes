“The first, which operated episodically over most of the last million-plus years, focused on the Suez isthmus and Levant as a periodically open passage from which pulses of African hominins and humans could percolate north of the basin, and more widely. For the second, associated with the rise in sedentism, plant and animal manipulation and ritual elaboration around the turn of the Holocene that gave us west Eurasian farming, the framework was the Fertile Crescent, a good proportion of which lay inside the basin. In neither instance was the Mediterranean beholden to a broader Near East as such. . . .

Only in the third phase of decisive impact from this quarter did the Near East as a whole play a key role, led by Mesopotamia and Egypt. This comprised the rise of urban, state-level societies, economies and culture over the later 4th and 3rd millennia BCE, and their expansion into adjacent parts of the Mediterranean, followed by major resurgences in the 2nd and early 1st millennia, as well as an underlying hum of lower-level ongoing interaction. That this last engagement gave a huge succession of boosts to the Mediterranean’s economies, as well as instilling long-lasting cultural practices in eastern parts of the basin, some of which would later be taken up more widely, is axiomatic. . . .

“And yet, as we have seen, and will now recapitulate, by the time Mesopotamia and Egypt had emerged, let alone the time that ripples of consequence reached the centre and west, most fundamental Mediterranean ways of doing things were already evident within the basin in an emergent form, and bearing their first fruit (albeit, in terms of political formations, initially more sustainably in the east, where tried-and-tested strategies for entrenching power could be more easily accessed).” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 594](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=552&annotation=VRI5J7KR))
