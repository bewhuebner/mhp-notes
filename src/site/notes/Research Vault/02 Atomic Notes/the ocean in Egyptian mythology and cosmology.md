“Amenhotep II was, according to his propaganda, king not just of Egypt but of the whole world: “All countries are under his fear. . . . All countries have his protection; his borders reach the rim of heaven, the lands are in his hand in a single knot. . . . His portion is that on which Ra shines, to him belongs what Ocean encircles.”” ([Podany, 2012, p. 167](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=192&annotation=W96CBRVV))
