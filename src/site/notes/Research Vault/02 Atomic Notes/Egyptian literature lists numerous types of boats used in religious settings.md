“In Egyptian religious practices of the Old Kingdom documented by the Pyramid Texts, names for 32 different boats used by Re, the king, and the gods in proper religious funerals and the afterlife indicate the importance of watercraft in mortuary ritual. The dead king boards the "great boat" and sails to the horizon with Re or travels with Re in another boat where, in Re's stead, he commands the crew and gives orders to the gods.' Although the names for the various boats are known and some representations include captions that tell us what type of craft is represented, making a connection between watercraft buried in mortuary complexes and religious literature has proved difficult.

No single, satisfactory explanation for the presence of watercraft in mortuary establishments has been offered, but the numbers of hulls and boat pits testify to their symbolic importance.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 69](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=77&annotation=WRIMV47K))
