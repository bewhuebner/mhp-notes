“Right around the same time that Amorite kings were coming to power in Mesopotamian and Syrian cities, the Twelfth Dynasty arose in Egypt (it began in 1985 BCE). During the same two centuries that the Amorite kingdoms vied with one another and created their whole web of alliances, the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty (all of them named either Amenemhet or Senusret) oversaw innumerable projects that strengthened Egypt and its economy. They reclaimed land from a lake to add to Egypt’s agricultural wealth, they sponsored expeditions and opened up copper and turquoise mines, and they traded with coastal cities in the Levant, especially with [[Byblos\|Byblos]]. The vizier of Egypt was in charge of preparing the boats that undertook this trade. According to one story from the time, a boat destined for Byblos docked near the king’s palace (the “Residence”), at a field owned by the vizier, and the vizier “loaded a Byblos-boat of the palace . . . with every good thing . . . from his house.” Not everyone was working hard, though. In an aside, the author noted that: “They spent the whole day (working) while his son made holiday.” Byblos was more Egyptian than ever by this time. The rulers there even wrote their inscriptions in Egyptian hieroglyphs, using cartouches for their names, just like the Egyptian kings. A compelling story was written down during the Twelfth Dynasty,” ([Podany, 2012, p. 112](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=137&annotation=35SRTGZJ))
