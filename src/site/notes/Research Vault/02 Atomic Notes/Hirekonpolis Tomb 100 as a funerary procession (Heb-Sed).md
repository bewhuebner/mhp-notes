“From the foregoing it seems clear that the only differences between the black vessel and the sickle­shaped vessel are their colors, the rounded cabins, and the high end  of the black vessel. We even have at least one good example of an Egyptian craft with a high and low end on a piece of Naqada I pottery (fig. 43), and rounded  cabins are not uncommon in Egyptian iconography. 19 More importantly, it is possible to explain the use of the black boat motif in the context of Egyptian culture.  William Smith interprets the mural as a funeral scene, and Williams and Logan interpret it as the Heb­-Sed ceremony with the bark procession as its core.20 In such a  context, it is plausible that the ceremonial bark would be altered so as to be readily distinguished. At the very least, we can say that no solid evidence exists to support  the theory that the Hierakonpolis mural records a conflict between Egyptians and foreigners, nor that the black vessel has any direct links with Mesopotamian craft of  the Late Uruk period.” ([Mark, 1998, p. 80](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=89&annotation=B9TITUSS))
