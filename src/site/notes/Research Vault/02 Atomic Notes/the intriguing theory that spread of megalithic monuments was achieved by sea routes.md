And yet one general feature seems to be clear. Since thousands of megalithic monuments have already been found, a huge number of positions can be charted on the globe, from Thailand, India or Madagascar to northern Europe. Within this huge and chronologically incoherent area, if we concentrate on the European and Mediterranean sector, one conclusion seems inescapable: this phenomenon must have spread by means of sea crossings. ([Location 1919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004FEFSCC&location=1919)) (Braudel 2001, p. 87)

If this indeed was the case, then the “cultural universe” of the megaliths moved from east to west. But it certainly did not do so in any regular fashion or from any single source. We shall be able to chart their spread, if spread there was, only when we have succeeded in dating all the megalithic monuments, region by region ([Location 1933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004FEFSCC&location=1933)) (Braudel 2001, p. 88)
