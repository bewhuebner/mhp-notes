“In the middle of the fourth century BCE the base of the main platform for speakers in the Forum was decorated with the bronze rams of enemy warships captured from the city of Antium during the Latin War, as if to symbolise the military foundation of Roman political power. The Latin word for ‘rams’, *rostra*, became the name of the platform and gave modern English its word *rostrum*.” ([Location 2175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0108U7IHO&location=2175)) (page 162)
