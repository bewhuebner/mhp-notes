“The boat from Mataria is the latest known Egyptian hull, built some 1,400 years after the Dashur boats. Its builders lived in a prosperous, yet unstable, time and probably were ruled by the Persian Empire (525-404 B.C.). A Greek colony at Naucratis in the Delta dates to the sixth century B.C., and the Late Period saw increasing numbers of foreign residents in Egypt, providing the opportunity for Egyptians to observe different technological practices. The Mataria hull reflects Egyptian nautical traditions that incorporated a feature of Mediterranean shipbuilding found in ships dating from the late Bronze Age to the Byzantine period.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 133](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=141&annotation=B585Z8UD))

“The Mataria hull provides the only evidence for the use of pegged mortise-and-tenon fastenings in Egyptian hull construction, although the fastening was known and used in the manufacture of furniture, coffins, and statues from the time of the First Dynasty. The large tenons continue an an ient tradition; the pegs might reflect hipbuilding techniques adopted by the Egyptians in the late New Kingdom (c. 1250 B.C.). We must distinguish, however, between the Mediterranean practice of locking every joint in place with pegs on either side of a plank seam and the Egyptian practice of using pegs, or treenails, in some joints.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 134](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=142&annotation=KE4UDPCQ))
