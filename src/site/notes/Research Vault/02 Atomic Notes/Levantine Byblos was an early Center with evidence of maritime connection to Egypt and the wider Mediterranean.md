“Although Egypt’s first seagoing ships take the limelight in terms of the formalization of maritime routes and explosion in scale, a few late 4th-millennium BCE stirrings of sea connections pre-date them. These take the form of crude boat images at Megiddo and Tel Erani, and a few pots netted from the seabed off Israel, one of Egyptian clay and still holding freshwater Nile molluscs, perhaps bait or a seafarer’s snack. And in one stretch of the central Levant where the plain between the sea and mountains narrows to just 4-5 km (2.5-3 miles), rendering alternatives to agriculture especially attractive, on a small cliff-girt promontory below the cedar-clad peaks of Lebanon, a few of the thousands of jar burials in the cemetery of one coastal village clustered around a spring became peculiarly rich in silver and other exotic imports. That community was Gebal, better known by its Greek name of Byblos (a suggestive reference to papyrus, and only thence to books), and its rise surely began as a local entrepot and instigator of sea traffic up and down the coast.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 301](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=278&annotation=IECQIVCI))
