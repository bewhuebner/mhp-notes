==“Three circular steatite stamp seals, dated to the end of the third millennium BC (c.2000 BC—de Graeve, 1981: 29), from Danish excavations on the upper Persian Gulf islands of Bahrain and Failaka, have representations of vessels on them (Figs. 3.7 , 8, 9). All three have near vertical ends which seems to be a characteristic of Mesopotamian and Persian Gulf craft of this era, possibly arising from the necessity to take vessels through the reed beds of the delta region.== One (Fig. 3.7) has vertical lines across the hull, which suggest this may be a bundle raft or a log raft lashed together, with an animal figurehead, possibly a gazelle or goat, at one end. Johnstone (1988: 174-5, fig- 13-6) has drawn comparisons with the huwayriyah (Fig. 3.10) (also warjiwa—de Graeve, 1981:159) used today by Kuwait fishermen: the sha-shah used on the Batinah coast of Oman is similar (R. Bowen, 1952:193-5). In constructional terms, these two twentieth-century craft are boat-shaped, log rafts, rather than bundle rafts, although the logs' which are lashed together are date palm boughs. Johnstone's suggestion that the vessel depicted on this first seal is a boat-shaped log raft, may be correct. The vessel on the second seal (Fig. 3.8) also has a gazelle-like figurehead at one end and its outline is similar to that on the first seal except that its bottom is flat rather than slightly rounded in profile. There is a mast stepped amidships with what may be a furled sail. As Johnstone (1980:176) suggests, this is probably a representation of a planked boat. The third seal (Fig. 3.9) also appears to show a planked boat, of similar form and with a midships mast. There are birds depicted on each end rather than a gazelle-like figurehead. At the stern sits a man, the steersman(?), holding lines from the masthead as well as a 'baton of authority'. There may be rigging lines at the foot of the mast and possibly a yard with furled sail, at the head. It seems reasonable to suggest then that, on this evidence, three types of vessels were involved in the late third-millennium BC Persian Gulf trade: boat-shaped log rafts, and bundle boats, for coastal and inshore work, possibly propelled by pole and paddle; and double-ended, planked craft with a single square sail on a midships mast, for overseas voyages .” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 62](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=62&annotation=ICTA2INL))
