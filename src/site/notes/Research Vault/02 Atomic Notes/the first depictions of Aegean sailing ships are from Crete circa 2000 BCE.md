“From around 2000 BCE Cretan seals start to depict the first sailing ships known in the Aegean. The generic similarity to the Byblos ships of the preceding millennium militates against independent invention, but this still raises questions. Were these eastern ships? If so, from where? Or do the images imply Cretan adoption of a technology picked up abroad, like uses of the wheel?” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 353](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=329&annotation=E37EQMEC))
