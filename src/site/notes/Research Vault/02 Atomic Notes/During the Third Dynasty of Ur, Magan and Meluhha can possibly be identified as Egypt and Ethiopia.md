“Ur-Nammu, in the prologue to his law code, speaks of returning the Magan-boat of Nanna on the boundary—an enigmatic statement, but one which seems to point to the importance attached to trade relations between Magan and Sinner. Economic documents from the time of the Third Dynasty of Ur mention such imports from Magan and Meluhha as copper, ivory, carnelian, and onions. In the post-Sumerian periods, we find Meluhha mentioned several times as a place of "black men," which leads naturally to an identification of Meluhha with Ethiopia. There are also a number of references to Magan and Meluhha in the Sumerian literary texts, published and unpublished, which are highly significant of the close relationship between Magan, Meluhha, and Sumer and which point to the identification of [[Encyclopedia/02 Places/Magan and Meluhha\|Magan and Meluhha]] with Egypt and Ethiopia. The references are as follows: 1. A three-line passage in the poem "Gilgamesh and the Land of the Living" which reads: After it had sunk, after it had sunk, After the Magan-boat had sunk, After the boat "The Might of Magilum" had sunk.” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 277](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=277&annotation=F9RNWZ5V))
