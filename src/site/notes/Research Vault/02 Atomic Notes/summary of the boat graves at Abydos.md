“More than 4,700 years ago, at least 12 boats were moored for eternity in the desert sands at Abydos, more than 11 kilometers from the Nile river. Entombed in mud-brick, boat-shaped graves, the hulls lay forgotten outside the funerary monuments of Egypt's earliest historic kings until late 1991, when a University of Pennsylvania-Yale Expedition to Abydos excavation team under the direction of Dr. David O'Connor uncovered this Early Dynastic fleet-the most ancient planked hulls in the world. 

The fleet at Abydos more than doubles the number of known Egyptian hulls, bringing the total of extant hulls to 20. Although more than 20 funerary sites in Egypt incorporated boat burials, there are twice as many boat graves at Abydos than at any other site. Before the Abydos find, Early Dynastic boat graves and hulls had been excavated at Saqqara, but little is known about the actual boats from mud-brick graves there. Sixteen model boats buried in a row east of the small Dynasty 6 pyramid of Queen Neit, also at Saqqara, provide the only parallel for such a large number of buried watercraft. Like the Abydos hulls buried nearly a millennium earlier, the Neit models are aligned on an east-west axis, but their burial represented only a fraction of the social and economic investment represented by entombed boats.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 38](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=48&annotation=ZRFU4NYZ))

“Trenches 10-25 centimeters deep were cut into bedrock and coated with mud plaster. After setting the boats into the plaster, workers built gently curving mud-brick walls about 30 centimeters thick and 50 centimeters high around each hull, coated the walls with mud plaster, and then whitewashed the entire structure. Weathering on the windward side of the graves suggests that the graves had been exposed for a long time.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=50&annotation=IW8VSGC2))
