“During the early years of the Eighteenth Dynasty, through the reigns of the various Thutmoses and of Hatshepsut, the kings put the old Hyksos capital city at [[Avaris\|Avaris]] in the Delta to good use. They used it in part as a military camp; it was dotted with grain silos to hold rations for the troops, and some soldiers were buried there. But the city was most important for its harbor, where ships from around the Mediterranean could dock, giving Egypt more access to international goods.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 148](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=173&annotation=85YHVVD2))

“The palace was decorated with beautiful wall paintings, rendered in reds, blues, greens, blacks, and browns on a white background. The artists who painted them were clearly not Egyptian but Minoan. They had come from Crete, perhaps with the specific commission of decorating this palace at Avaris.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 148](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=173&annotation=IF2JWA3P))

“The brightly painted griffins at Avaris may well have flanked a stone throne, just as they did at Knossos. The excavator believes that a Minoan princess might have received visitors while seated on the throne.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 149](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=174&annotation=4TUAIVWJ))
