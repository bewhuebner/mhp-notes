“But the best example at this juncture is [[Lipari\|Lipari]]. The earliest settlers of the 6th millennium BCE lived in farming plots scattered over its countryside. Around 5000 BCE , however, a new, village-level community of 100-200 people arose on the island’s later acropolis and current capital, a defensible point overlook­ing the best harbour. While Lipari’s obsidian was flowing out over the central Mediterranean, the acropolis site obtained a remarkable number of fine stone axes and flints from overseas, as well as exceptional quantities of painted pots, normally reserved for ritual use by their closest Calabrian neighbours, and only more readily available 150-200 km (90-125 miles) away. Potting clay was also brought in, hardly a standard item of exchange at this time, and an important hint that some of these imports were acquired abroad by the islanders themselves. By the end of the 5th millennium BCE, copper ores were being imported for local smelting, and on the plain of Contrada di Diana, just below the acropolis, a further hub of activity came into being. It consisted of an extensive spread of large open-air earth ovens, masses of debris from obsidian production, numerous fine axes, and grinding stones stained with ochre. One attractive interpretation of this strange accumulation is that it reflects the residues of seasonal gatherings of strangers as well as locals, drawn by the magnet of obsidian but also the chance to trade, feast, socialize and swap news in the midst of the sea with people from far away. Such scenarios were unthinkable a millennium earlier, and symbolize the start of the Mediterranean islands’ coming of age.” (Broodbank, 2013, p. 217-18) (pdf)
