“The era that encompassed Amenhotep III’s reign and that of his son Akhenaten is known as the Amarna period. It was a time of unprecedented international cooperation.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 191](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=216&annotation=GWJYRSJ8))

“The brotherhood of great kings, through much of Amenhotep III’s reign, probably only included Egypt, Mittani, and Babylonia. Hatti had been a great power before and would become one again, but it was going through a period of weakness. No letters were found at Amarna that had been sent between the king of Hatti and Amenhotep III, and the pharaoh wrote at one point, “I have heard that everything is finished and the country Hattusa is shattered.” Amenhotep III also corresponded with kings in Alashiya (Cyprus) and Arzawa (in western Anatolia), but they were not at the same level of power and importance as Babylonia and Mittani.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 191](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=216&annotation=8YTWIJEU))

“Amenhotep seemed to have had an insatiable desire for foreign wives.  
In fact, all of the letters from Amenhotep III, as well as many of the quotes attributed to him in other letters, were at least in part about women.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 194](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=219&annotation=RB6XNMTY))
