“**First**, how and why did empires ruled from within the Mediterranean first arise? Before 500 BCE, empire-scale integration had been pretty well entirely imposed from outside the basin, if we set aside the uncertain, spatially modest case of Minoan Crete (well within the scale of an ambitious territorial state in the contemporary east), and potential 6th-century BCE moves in this direction by Carthage. Shortly afterwards, however, new kinds of empires superbly adapted to, and successfully exploitative of, the Mediterranean’s attributes and rhythms begin to be seen, first in the guises of an explicit hegemony on the part of Carthage and the shorter-lived but highly centralized and truly colony-establishing 5th-century Athenian empire, and in its most extensive, durable form under Rome, the vast majority of whose subjects lived within the basin.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 606](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=564&annotation=A76QQ27A))

“. . . The growth of empires within the Mediterranean resulted in large part from determined thalassocratic efforts to regulate the sea’s traffic and legislate behaviour on it. These, if still never entirely successful, were decisively more so than in the past, thanks primarily to ever-larger resources to throw at the problem. Freya Stark’s ‘law-encircled sea’ was gradually established,14as well as its inverse, at least if we define piracy by its widely acknowledged illegality rather than the time-honoured practice of maritime predation as such, with Etruscans on the losing side in the Tyrrhenian Sea among the first true ‘pirates’. In the late 6th century, Polycrates of Samos fingered the thalassocratic mantle, and it may have been at his court that a poet first coined ‘Aegean’ (a term of obscure, non-Greek derivation, possibly from a long-lost, ancient sea god) for the patchwork of sea and islands that his ships sought to dominate. Further great strides in this direction were made by 5th-century Athens, Carthage relied upon its warships for projecting power abroad and Rome, for all its land-based conquests, represented the acme of thalassocracy, finally killing off the most blatant forms of piracy and entirely eliminating enemy fleets from the Mediterranean. With at least this disruptive facet of the marine realm coerced, the long-dormant yet enormous potential for a central sea to facilitate the fast, reliable communications and huge redistributions essential for sustaining an internal empire was at last unleashed. A compelling case can in fact be made that the gradual shift from the first riverine corridors of power to the surroundings of a massively larger sea, and the lack of a similarly extensive and centrally placed watery zone further east, helped to keep the core zone at the western end of Eurasia ahead of that in the east (based around China), until the 6th or 7th centuries AD , when the Mediterranean fell apart again.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 607](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=565&annotation=3G57ZZCX))

“**Second**, why were Mediterranean polities over the coming few centuries so outstandingly successful at political expansion beyond the basin, a process that further hastened the Mediterranean on its way to becoming a crossroads of interaction not simply between its constituent shores (as we have seen over this book’s time span), but between much more extensive continental hinterlands?” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 607](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=565&annotation=Z4IQ9QV4))

“**Third**, stemming from the above, why did so many of the material and other traits practised and brought together by Greek people (often from foreign origins) start to be so widely adopted as a common vocabulary across the basin?” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 607](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=565&annotation=ZPZ2Z3HA))

“**Fourth**, if surely far from finally, why did the Classical Mediterranean witness so many world-changing conceptual and religious breakthroughs concerning relations between the individual, society, politics and the transcendent? A few hints have been offered in this book, notably the increasingly non-sacral nature of political authority in several regions, its frequently fragmented and contested basis, and the early lead established by areas on the interacting yet also resistant edges of the old Near Eastern heartland of power and knowledge, in the southern Levant and Aegean. But much has not been explained. Fuller answers lie in the direction of seeing the Mediterranean as a prominent case within the broader contemporary rise of such ‘axial age’ thought, in response to new forms of political reality, across widely separated parts of Eurasia.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 608](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=566&annotation=FQ339H96))
