“With the goods and myths came writing, as seen at Pithekoussai and, earlier, at the first Phoenician stopping points mentioned in Chapter 9. Alphabetical scripts originated in the later 2nd-millennium BCE Levant, as merchants and other go-betweens sought to break the written word free from the limits of clay and formalities of scribal learning enshrined in cuneiform, and to promote mobile practices, easier learning and simpler transfers. Unsurprisingly, Iron Age expansion of the alphabet coincided with the decline of cylinder seals, and their rolled-out, recondite iconography, in favour of stamp seals bearing punchy, readily grasped images, which show up all over the basin. However, the pattern of adoption of the alphabet was more complex than it might at first seem. The Phoenician version circulated very widely and, with several consonants that were surplus to requirement in other languages switched to denote vowels in the early 8th century, an exceptionally speech-like variant emerged to write Greek and soon Italian languages. But where this began within a string of possibilities running from Euboea all the way to central Italy still remains anyone’s guess. Crete, though riddled with Phoenician traits and long ago home to the first Mediterranean script beyond the Levant, was an oddly late starter, and the best bets lie further west, among polyglot communities such as Pithekoussai, where bi- or trilingualism must have been commonplace. In contrast, Cyprus enjoyed an unbroken tradition of literacy and mercantile trade, yet, outside the orbit of Kition, stuck stubbornly to local syllabic script for centuries to come.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 518](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=484&annotation=IA8TKB6A))
