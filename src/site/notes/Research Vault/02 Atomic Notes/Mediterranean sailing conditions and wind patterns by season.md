### A Sailor’s Perspective

#### Broodbank

“Currents are only a modest help or hindrance to Mediterranean mariners. Far more relevant are the winds, whose names – *mistral*, *bora*, *tramontana*, *meltemi*, *levanter*, *scirocco*, *khamsin* and many more – conjure up as romantic a response in northern sensibilities as they do a practical respect among Mediterranean navigators. A strong blast can neutralize or reverse the surface current. Moreover, wind direction and intensity fluctuate wildly and unpredictably. True, the prevailing pattern consists of winds from the north, most violent between October and March. But as ever, Mediterranean generalizations are of limited validity.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 74](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=72&annotation=SBJKCKXK))

==“From the seaman's viewpoint the summer, with its long daylight hours, also has welcome characteristics, the main problem being the relatively high number (up to 20 percent) of days with little or no wind. The winter, however, can be a dangerous time for, in addition to offshore local gale-force winds such as the Bora (see below) , there are many occasions when outbreaks of cold air from between north-west and north-east penetrate the region, resulting in very boisterous conditions and considerable seas, with severe squalls and thunderstorms which may develop rapidly with little warning (Mediterranean Pilot, 5, 1988:17).” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 92](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=92&annotation=PK3JCRCD))==

### Winter Winds

“There was some winter sailing in the Classical world, mainly in connection with wars or when shortages forced the unseasonal import of grain, but it did not become a regular feature of the Mediterranean until the sixteenth century AD: in earlier times summer was the sailing season. The Greek poet, Hesiod, of c.700 BC, admittedly a landlubber, advised restricting seagoing to fifty days in July and August (Works and Days, 663-5). Vegetius (Res Mil 4.39) gave what is probably a more realistic picture: June to mid-September was considered safe; mid-March to the end of May, and mid-September to mid-November were risky periods; and from mid-November to mid-March was the period known as mare clausum, 'the seas are closed'.” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 93](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=93&annotation=3IJ95WG6))

### Summer Winds

“Summer winds are, and were, highly predictable in the eastern Mediterranean and Aegean—hence the name Etesian wind, the 'annual' wind. In this respect it may be thought of as a 'monsoon' wind, from between north-west and north-east in the Aegean, and between west and north in the eastern Mediterranean. The situation is more variable in the western basin: for example, west of Cape Bon, the chances of there being a wind from the sector east-north-east (34 per cent) are very similar to the chances of a wind from west-northwest (33 per cent). This means that, in an average sum mer week, for a ship which could make good a track at right angles to the wind, the wind in these western coastal waters would be fair for a westbound voyage for three days, and fair for an eastbound voyage also for three days, with one day of light, variable winds or calms.” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 93](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=93&annotation=WHE4WENM))

### How Winds Dictate Sailing Routes

#### Broodbank

“Prevailing winds would, over time, select for particular axes of movement, especially for long crossings reliant on runs of steady weather, as well as choices of seasonally sheltered anchorages, with accumulating knowledge of successful runs encouraging convergence upon them and so the emergence over time, and under specific social conditions, of regular routes and hubs.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 75](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=73&annotation=ZLVR5ZZI))

“There are two main conclusions about open-sea ship operations which emerge from this summary of the distribution of wind directions in the twentieth century Mediterranean, which, for reasons given above, seem likely to be similar to those of the ancient world. These conclusions are most readily formulated in relation to sailing ships which could make good a track at right angles to the wind. 
- In the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean in the summer months, the Etesian/Meltemi wind is, and was, so overwhelmingly predominant that there was little point in waiting for a fair wind for voyages on headings from west through north to east in the Aegean, and for headings from south-west through north to north-east in the eastern Mediterranean. Alternative routes had to be found; land and sea breezes (4.2.3.4) or other local meteorological phenomena could be used when and where they overwhelmed the Etesian wind; or voyages could be attempted earlier or later in the year. 
- Outside this region, and in the pre- and post summer months in the eastern Mediterranean, there was generally sufficient variability in the wind direction over a period of two or three weeks for voyages in many, but not all, directions to be attempted, providing that the Master was prepared to heave-to, or remain in harbour, during periods of foul winds. Generally speaking, the delays encountered in late spring and early autumn were significantly shorter than in summer.” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 94](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=94&annotation=KXBVX7JK))
