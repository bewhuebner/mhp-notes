These connections were essentially multidirectional, but one of the hubs was certainly Sardinia, which faced all the participants, and where nuragic societies now reached their peak of hierarchical organization.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 493](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=460&annotation=HKQF8EWT))

“Bronze votives of masted boats, often with a stag or bull figurehead, point to an additional avenue for wealth accumulation through off-island ventures that, given Sardinia’s location, must often have entailed voyages of some magnitude. Two massive bronze bull heads recovered from a later shrine in the Balearics may once have adorned the prows of Sardinian vessels, and there are reports of a wreck off the island’s west coast, facing the wild seaway to Iberia. Moreover, Sardinian traders were equally drawn to northern Etruria, another metalliferous land, where their pots and bronzes, including figurines and boats, pre-date east Mediterranean objects in hoards, shrines and burials. All this should make us receptive to the idea that a scatter of jug-like Sardinian pots in Iberia, Sicily, Crete and North Africa, which overlaps with Phoenician arrivals in the centre and west, may reflect the passage of Sardinian as well as eastern traders.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 493-94](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=461&annotation=VNI29QGX))
