“A generation or so following Mesilim's reign, 2450 B.C. or thereabouts, a man named [[Ur-Nanshe\|Ur-Nanshe]] established himself as king of Lagash and founded a dynasty which was to endure for five generations. We do not know where Ur-Nanshe came from or how he rose to power—there is even a bare possibility that he was originally not a Sumerian but a Semite from a land known as Tidnum, to die west of Sumer. Be that as it may, he has left behind him some fifty inscriptions on tablets, plaques, door sockets, bricks, and nails, which record primarily the building of temples, digging of canals, and fashioning of divine statues. One of the sentences occurring repeatedly in these inscriptions, however, carries political and economic implications of a rather startling character, although it is to be noted that the translation here offered is not yet fully assured. The statement reads, "The ships of Dilmun brought him (Ur-Nanshe) wood as a tribute from foreign lands," which implies that Ur-Nanshe was powerful enough to control a number of foreign lands beyond the Persian Gulf. To date, however, there is no other evidence to verify so far-reaching a claim, and it may be advisable to let the matter rest as uncertain for the present.” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 53](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=53&annotation=EZBJVAML))
