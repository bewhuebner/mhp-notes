“Votive inscriptions and date-formulas, royal epistles and lists of rulers and dynasties, epic songs of victory and bitter laments of defeat—all these hardly add up to history as we like to think of it. Moreover, -==for approximately the first two millenniums of Sumer's existence we have practically no written historical documents at all==, and the votive inscriptions which we have from the later periods come from only a few Sumerian sites and therefore tend to give a one-sided picture of the events they record.” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 38](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=38&annotation=YT7PQRNT))
