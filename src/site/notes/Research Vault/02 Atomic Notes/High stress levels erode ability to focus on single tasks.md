“Hypervigilance is essentially when you’re looking out for the bear around every corner. Your attention is focused on cues for potential danger, as opposed to being focused on being present with what’s going on, or the lesson you’re supposed to be learning, or doing the work you were supposed to be doing. It’s not that [people in this state are] not paying attention. It’s that they’re paying attention to any cues or signs of threat or danger in their environment. That is where their focus is.” ([Location 2720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093G9TS91&location=2720))

To pay attention in normal ways, you need to feel safe. You need to be able to switch off the parts of your mind that are scanning the horizon for bears or lions or their modern equivalents, and let yourself sink down into one secure topic.

they found that “problems with money are really not good for concentration…. If you have to worry about your financial situation…it takes a lot of the capacity of your brain.
