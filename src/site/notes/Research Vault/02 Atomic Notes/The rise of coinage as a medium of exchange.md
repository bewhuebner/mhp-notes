“Coinage began as one of several ways of marking and thereby underwriting modest denominations of metal; it had clear precursors in 8th-century BCE Levantine experiments with inscribing weight units. True coins started to be minted within a decade or two on either side of 600 BCE, by Lydia to judge by their emblem of lion’s head and paws, and the first known were found alongside stamped weights at Lydia’s maritime outlet of Ephesus, a city-state where Anatolian and Greek traditions mingled around a famous shrine to Artemis. They were made from electrum, an unassailable alloy that forced users to accept their face value rather than unknowable metallic worth. One plausible hypothesis is that these coins were intended for issuing pay to mercenaries, and for spending internally.”

“In fact, the observation that early minting mapped not only onto major hubs of trade (most devoid of their own source of silver), but also onto the exceptionally competitive world of Greek city-states, hints that the issuing of coins with polity- specific emblems was a major symbolic means of projecting civic identity. Hence the distinctive sea turtles stamped onto coins of Aegina, Phocaea’s equally marine seal, Athena’s owl or Metapontion’s ear of grain, as well as subtler messages of dual affiliation, such as among the cluster of ‘Ionian’ city-states in the east Aegean that sometimes shared a common design on one face, asserting their individuality on the other. The origins and spread of coinage are embedded in the Mediterranean’s past, just as much as they presage its future.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 556](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=522&annotation=2PV7E93T))
