Another Enki myth tells an intricate and as yet somewhat obscure tale involving the paradise-land [[Encyclopedia/02 Places/Dilmun\|Dilmun]], perhaps to be identified in part with ancient India. Very briefly sketched, the plot of this Sumerian "paradise" myth, which treats of gods, not humans, runs as follows: Dilmun is a land that is "pure," "clean” and "bright," a "land of the living" which knows neither sickness nor death. What is lacking, however, is the fresh water so essential to animal and plant life. The great Sumerian water-god, Enki, therefore orders Utu, the sun-god, to fill it with fresh water brought up from the earth. Dilmun is thus turned into a divine garden, green with fruit-laden fields and meadows.” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 147](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=147&annotation=TT942H5U))
