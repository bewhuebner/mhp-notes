“During the later 7th century connections took off. The instigators came from the Mediterranean, with geography and timing guaranteeing the priority of ventures from the Aegean, itself almost half the size of the Black Sea, but far more island-studded, densely populated and networked. For once there is not a trace of a Phoenician presence, although more local activities probably wait to be revealed. The Black Sea became in effect a marine extension of Aegean Greece. East Aegean people, particularly from Miletus, took the lead, perhaps aiming to compensate themselves for losses of land and metal access to the expanding power of Lydia. As the wealth to be gained became apparent, and city-state identities and interests more sharply delineated, the long, slender gateway to the Black Sea became the scene of a fast and fierce scramble for advantage. Megara gained an early foothold with the foundation of Byzantium, but during the 6th century Athens achieved a decisive hegemony that it would doggedly maintain until eventual naval catastrophe there in 405 BCE spelt its defeat in the Peloponnesian War.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 576](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=542&annotation=T3ZIIQHL))
