“During the past 7,000 years, from the late Neolithic period onwards, changes in the main climatic parameters have, in general , been insufficient to significantly alter seafaring conditions. Rates of sea level change during these millennia have varied, not only regionally but also locally, so that data from one site cannot necessarily be applied to another nearby. Nevertheless, past sea levels and former coastlines can be deduced with reasonable accuracy from global sea level data, providing tectonic and glacial effects are taken into account (van Andel, 1989). During the past 3,000 years (from the Iron Age) sea level changes have been of limited significance from the seafaring viewpoint, for example, it has been estimated that since the Roman period mean sea level has risen by less than 0.5 m. Of more consequence in that period have been the changes caused by coastal erosion, silting and other forms of deposition, including soil erosion due to changes in vegetational cover.” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 89](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=89&annotation=LKJ4G8W3))
