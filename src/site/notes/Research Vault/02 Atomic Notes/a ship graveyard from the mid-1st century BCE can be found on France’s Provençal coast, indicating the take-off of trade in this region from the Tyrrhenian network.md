“The wider world’s irruption began in the later 7th century, as part of the overall Tyrrhenian push by Etruscan traders, especially from Caere and Vulci, though others quickly joined in. One approach route is delineated by a veritable marine graveyard of ships between Antibes and the Rhone delta, a grim testimony to the savagery of the Provençal coast and a credit to the intensity of underwater exploration, rivalled in the Mediterranean only off southern Turkey and northern Israel. As a target of Etruscan trade, France soon overtook the older markets of Sardinia, Sicily and Carthage. This trade concentrated on exports of wine to the hitherto beer- or mead-drinking locals, accompanied by elaborate serving and drinking vessels in metal or *bucchero* pottery, with Greek amphorae and fine painted pots, plus a few Phoenician items, riding upon this or arriving in other hulls.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 564](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=530&annotation=M54SRM8Q))
