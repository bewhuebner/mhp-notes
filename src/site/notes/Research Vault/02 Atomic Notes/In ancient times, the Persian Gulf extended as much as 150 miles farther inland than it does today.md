## prehistoric coastlines

“The Arabo-Persian Gulf (Fig.1) is a relatively recent sea that started to be formed after the last glacial maximum around 16 000 BC due to increase of sea level. The rise of sea level stopped approximately shortly before 4000 BC when present-day shoreline was reached (Dingwall 2014: p.20-24).” ([Hájek, 2019, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/954FE4QW)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CFG7JNU2?page=12&annotation=5938FPMB))

“Although present day Iranian coastline was reached around 8000 BC (Dingwall 2014: p.22-23), the coast of Arabian peninsula was established in later sixth millennium BC, according to spatial distribution of coastal Ubaid-related sites (Carter 2010a: p.193). Around 5600 BC, sea level was at least 1-2 metres above present day levels and reached southernmost Mesopotamian sites as Ur (Fig.2)(Pournelle 2003b: p.120-121). Present day sea levels were reached around 4000 BC (Dingwall 2014: p.23).” ([Hájek, 2019, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/954FE4QW)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CFG7JNU2?page=14&annotation=GT3KSDPW))

## historic coastlines

“Today, in the south, the Tigris and Euphrates merge into the Shatt al-Arab before jointly emptying into the sea; but in ancient times they flowed into the Persian Gulf separately. In those days (during the fourth and third millennia B.C.E.) the Gulf extended as much as 150 miles farther inland than it does today, making ancient cities like Ur and Eridu (inland today) virtual seaports. Over the centuries, heavy accumulations of silt deposited by the rivers along with the sea’s own retreat pushed the coastline south.” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=16&annotation=J5GC4VJI))
