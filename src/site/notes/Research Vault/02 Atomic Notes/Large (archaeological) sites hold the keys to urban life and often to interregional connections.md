Consider the forty-plus seasons conducted by French teams since 1929 at [[Ugarit\|Ugarit]], the capital of a kingdom in the 2nd millennium BCE, which have yielded the early Mediterranean’s broadest exposure of palaces, temples, houses and tombs, together with their contents, including imports from as far afield as Egypt, the Aegean and central Asia, as well as state and private archives that offer breathtaking prospects.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 32](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=31&annotation=FLGXU8MN))
