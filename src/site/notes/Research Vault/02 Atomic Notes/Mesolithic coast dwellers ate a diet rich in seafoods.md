“At Grotta dell’Uzzo analysis of human skeletons reveals a diet rich in sea and plant foods, and the molluscs eaten tell us that at first people used the cave only in winter, but later frequented it year-round as they took more to fishing during the 8th-7th-millennium BCE pan-Mediterranean burgeoning of sea life. A similar pattern is evident on the east Adriatic coast; highlights are a base camp at Vela Spilja on Korcula, with thick layers full of the remains of small fish and rarely big ones, as well as dolphins, molluscs and land animals, a string of newly identified sites from Albania to northwest Greece, and the long known midden above Sidari beach on Corfu. But two areas stand out in terms of marine lifestyles, albeit in different ways, one showing how these could tether people and make them relatively sedentary, the other, in quite different circumstances, connected with widespread travel across the sea.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 180](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=167&annotation=3E6A9RSJ))
