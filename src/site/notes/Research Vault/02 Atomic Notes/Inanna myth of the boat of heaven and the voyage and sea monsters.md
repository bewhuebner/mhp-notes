“Inanna is only too happy to accept the gifts offered her by the drunken Enki. She takes them and loads them on her "boat of heaven," and embarks for Erech with her precious cargo. But after the effects of the banquet have worn off, Enki notices that the me's are gone from their usual place. He turns to Isimud, who informs him that he, Enki himself, presented them to his daughter, Inanna. Greatly upset, Enki regrets his munificence and decides to prevent at all costs the "boat of heaven" from reaching Erech. He therefore dispatches his messenger together with a group of sea monsters to follow Inanna and her boat to the first of the seven stopping stations that are situated between the Abzu of Eridu and Erech. Here the sea monsters are to seize the "boat of heaven" from Inanna; Inanna herself, however, must be permitted to continue her journey to Erech afoot.” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 161](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=161&annotation=YKF72GZD)) #USE in [[Maritime History Podcast/03 In-Progress Notes/011 - Notes\|011 - Notes]]
