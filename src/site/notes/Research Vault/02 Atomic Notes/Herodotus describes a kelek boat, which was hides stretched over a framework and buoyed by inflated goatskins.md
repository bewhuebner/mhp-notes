#USE in [[001 - Boating in Ancient Mesopotamia\|001 - Boating in Ancient Mesopotamia]]

“Smaller vessels included the coracle and the kelek. The coracle is still in use in Iraq today where it goes by the Arabic name of [[quffa\|quffa]]. Its shape led the ancients to call it a “turnip.” Resembling a round reed basket, the coracle’s natural buoyancy was enhanced by a watertight coating of bitumen. Both locomotion and direction were achieved with the help of a punting pole or oar, since Mesopotamian boats lacked a rudder.” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 252](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=265&annotation=HWFQIFUZ))

“Apart from the majestic city of Babylon, the most surprising thing the Greek traveler [[Herodotus\|Herodotus]] saw during his visit to Mesopotamia was the [[kelek\|kelek]]. Unlike the round coracle, the round kelek was made of hides stretched over a frame of willow branches, and it was ingeniously disassembled after it had served its purpose. (See Herodotus History 1: 194.)” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 253](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=266&annotation=YI52RRNM))

“Vessels could be made even more buoyant by attaching inflated goatskins to the hull. Where the goat’s neck had been, the skin was sewn tight, as was the hide at the ends of three of the legs. The opening at the end of the fourth leg was then used like the mouth of a balloon to inflate the rest of the hide, after which the opening was tied shut. Assyrian art depicts soldiers clinging to goatskin “water wings” as they make their way across a river; if air leaked out, more could be added by blowing into the tightly gripped mouth of the “balloon.” Assyrian art likewise shows enemies using such flotation devices to help them swim away and evade capture.” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 253](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=266&annotation=BCIB8VSX))
