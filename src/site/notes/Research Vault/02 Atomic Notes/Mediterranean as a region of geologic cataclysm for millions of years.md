One of the most ancient of mural paintings (and I mean mural, not cave painting) in a temple at Çatal Höyük in Anatolia dating from 6200 B.C., represents a volcanic eruption, probably of the nearby Hasan Dag. We shall have occasion to return to the “Plutonian” convulsions of the earth’s crust apropos of Minoan Crete, notably the cataclysmic explosion of the nearby island of Thera (known today as Santorini) in about 1470–1450 B.C.
