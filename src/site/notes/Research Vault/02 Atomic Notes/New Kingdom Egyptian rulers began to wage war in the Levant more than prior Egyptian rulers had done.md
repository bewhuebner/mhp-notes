“The second initiative was the 18th Dynasty’s policy of taking the war to the Levant, in recognition of the fact that the Avaris phenomenon did not end with the Delta, and symptomatic of the rising prominence of soldierly values, and a standing army, in New Kingdom Egyptian society. Under Ahmose this got as far as Gaza and the destruction, after a siege, of Sharuhen. Soon afterwards, Thutmose I and Thutmose III (1504-1492 BCE and 1479-1425 BCE, respectively) advanced as far as the Euphrates, gathering booty and submission along the way, campaigns partly responsible for the destructions attested archaeologically at south Levantine towns in the course of the 16th and early 15th centuries BCE. On the side, Thutmose III hunted some of the last Asian elephants in the Ghab wetlands – one of the huge shoulder blades from which was recently unearthed at Qatna. We revisit this expansion and its consequences for the Levant later. For now the key point is that such interventions gradually morphed from the age-old wealth-gathering razzias and smitings of the Asiatic into the imposition of a more durable overlordship and permanently extended resource control – the genesis, in short, of a rudimentary empire.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 387](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=363&annotation=9QJH7NMR))
