“Looked at another way, the expansion of the middling, sub-elite sort, identified in Athens itself by archaeology as early as the 8th century and later in Solonic writing, was a widespread feature across the Mediterranean, in some regions from even earlier times; where coupled with weak elite authority it made power-sharing solutions more or less inevitable. In this sense the creation of several tens of thousands of adult male citizens throughout Athens and Attica (at best a fifth of the total population, and, of course, excluding all women, slaves and foreigners) simply represented one end of a spectrum that ran through large, inclusive oligarchies such as Sparta’s. Moreover, it is estimated that even under democracy as little as a tenth or twentieth of all Athenians retained the ownership of nearly a third of the land. It is likewise unclear to what extent similar arrangements may have sprung up elsewhere at an early stage, for our sources come overwhelmingly from Athens, which as a major polity set the subsequent standard. As with the Roman republic, whose inception lies around the same time, we are quickly caught in circular reasoning: did such reforms make these city-states genuinely exceptionally successful and thereby lead to preferential survival of their records, or did later serendipities ensure the latter, and make these places appear more unusual than they once were? And yet for all these misgivings, and even setting aside its symbolic potency today, the Athenian democracy and its cultural hothouse environment offered something qualitatively, and in its eventual form, radically, new – a different course from most of the remainder of the basin, where the deeply rooted ‘Archaic’ world evolved seamlessly into its successors.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 583](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=549&annotation=H2HJMLTE))
