#USE in [[001 - Boating in Ancient Mesopotamia\|001 - Boating in Ancient Mesopotamia]] re: early reed boats

â€œClay tablets of c.2000 BCE list some of the material used to build water transport, including hide, pitch, and caulking (Bass, 1972:14). The hide was presumably used to build hide boats, and the caulking was possibly for planked boats, but there may be a translation problem here. The pitch could also have been a plank caulking, but is more likely to have been used to make reed-bundle boats watertight. Reed-bundle boats of two distinct shapes are known in this region today: the boat-shaped [[zaima\|zaima]] (Fig. 3.4) and *jillabie* and the round-shaped [[quffa\|quffa]] (Fig. 3.5) (McGrail, 1998:163-4). They are built of reed bundles linked by coiled basketry with an inserted stiffening of light willows; the linked bundles are then coated externally with bitumen.
