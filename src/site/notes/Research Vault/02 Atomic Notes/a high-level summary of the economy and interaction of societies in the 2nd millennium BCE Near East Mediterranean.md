“At a rough guess (supported by the number of substantial consumers of that convenient tracer, Aegean painted pottery), by the later 2nd millennium BCE a network of some forty to fifty principal producing, trading and consuming centres existed around the east Mediterranean, from the Nile Delta to the Peloponnese, typically if not always centred on palaces, and most definable as urban. Beyond, innumerable further communities fed into the system; these received trickle-down benefits to varying degrees, albeit in many cases reaching zero and, in the most exploitative cases, negative equity. Alongside internal redistributive mechanisms, and a broader culture of socially embedded exchange, market-like conditions flourished, building on the ‘long’ 3rd millennium’s establishment of proto-currencies, and with a number of the major trade products now standardized and commodified. Widespread interaction went hand in hand with a growing convergence of cultural practices at the more exalted levels. But while this created a broad consensus in terms of the relative esteem in which overall categories of materials and objects were held, and while the smoother flows of goods did quite a lot to reduce distinctions in the exchange values of the same thing in different places, on-the-spot prices across space and time clearly continued to vary and offer ample opportunities for profit. The reasons lie in familiar Mediterranean conditions: the uneven distribution of coveted resources, fluctuations in harvests and other conditions within each micro-region, and the fickle navigational and other transport conditions controlling access to each, as well as the general speed of movement between them. To this we might add the unsynchronized cycles of consumption at each centre, which guaranteed frequent swings in localized supply and demand. Finally, the palatial strategy of stockpiling a spectrum of desirable materials and goods as a form of capital accumulation, and the exchange value of such things when put into circulation, ensured that the pathways along which each moved when re-injected into the network described patterns far more complex than simply transfer from points of natural occurrence to ones of absence; Keftiu carrying elephant tusks to Egypt are just one Bronze Age version of coals-to Newcastle, and made perfect sense.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 413-14](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=389&annotation=27E5YS35))
