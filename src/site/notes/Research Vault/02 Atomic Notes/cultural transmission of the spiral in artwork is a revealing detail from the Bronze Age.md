It is more interesting to chart the progress of the spiral, which turns up all over the place in the Aegean in the third millennium: it is found on the “frying pans” of Syros, on handsome stone jars in Crete, and on jewels in Troy II (Priam’s treasure, as Schliemann called it). From about 2000 it turns up simultaneously in the Mari frescoes, on the ceilings of Egyptian tombs and palaces, and decorating the fantastic animals of the fine polychrome pottery known as “Cappadocian,” made at Kanesh (Kültepe) at a time when the pre-Hittite town was home to a colony of Assyrian merchants. The spiral is found on Egyptian seals and jewellery from the Twelfth Dynasty, on ceramics in Crete and other islands in the Aegean, on Cyprus porcelain, on the tombs with tholoi in Boeotia, and even in the spiral curls in the beard of a god (or prince) at Mari—something which might seem quite natural of course, but their perfect geometrical regularity is surprising. The god of war on the doors of the Hittite palace of Bogasköy (sixteenth century B.C.) even has a sort of loin-cloth covered in spirals. This detail, insignificant in itself, is a timely reminder that cultural exchanges could proceed by numerous modest and unexpected paths.
