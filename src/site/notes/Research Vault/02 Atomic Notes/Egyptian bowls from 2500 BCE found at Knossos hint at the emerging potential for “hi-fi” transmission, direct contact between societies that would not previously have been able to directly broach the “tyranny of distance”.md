“Mochlos was one plausible terminus, where rowlocks shown on in its small clay boat models hint that the idea of oars to replace paddles escaped west ahead of the sail, though other intermediaries must have existed, including on Rhodes, the gateway to and from the Aegean. Yet the sea-route offered the alternative possibility of direct communication without intervening participants, one that might convey objects and ideas associated with ‘civilized’ behaviour faithfully over great distances. A residue of such hi-fi transmission may be preserved in a few Egyptian bowls made of grey-white mottled anorthosite gneiss, found unstratified at Knossos. If these arrived near the time of their manufacture (2600-2200 BCE) , this would be of great interest, for such bowls were associated in Egypt with royalty and its immediate circle, and in the Levant concentrate at the palace of Ebla, where they are thought to be pharaonic gifts. Such meaning-rich, prestigious trophies would be precisely the kind of things sought by aspiring Aegean elites, or granted them as tokens of recognition. Direct contacts with Egypt are unlikely, and unnecessary given that these things could be found closer to hand in the Levant.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 338](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=315&annotation=MGXDCAKV))
