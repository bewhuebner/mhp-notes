“Amphora production had never extended beyond the easternmost Mediterranean in the Bronze Age, but in the Iron Age it went universal. The Aegean had long abandoned its peculiar stirrup jars, and by the 7th century BCE its distinctive amphorae reached both ends of the Mediterranean; Italy developed its own range, and derivatives of Phoenician types were turned out in Sardinia and Iberia, the latter’s sometimes for bottling piquant fish preserves ultimately derived from refined east Mediterranean cuisines. In the centre of the basin, early Carthage, despite having set up its own vineyards and olive groves on African soil from as near to the outset as we can detect, imported many amphora-loads from Sardinia, substantial numbers from Etruria and the Levant, and a few from Iberia, Sicily, the Aegean and Pithekoussai (where both Phoenician and Aegean forms were emulated).” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 516-17](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=483&annotation=8QZNAE46))
