“Timber resources in Egypt were probably greater than has been suggested in the past, particularly if the use and abundance of acacia, sycamore, and tamarisk are considered. Foreign timber was available but extremely expensive. Both local and foreign timber resources were under royal control, although trade on an individual level also occurred. The use of so many different imported woods and the quantities of wood imported imply that the Egyptians were economically powerful.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=33&annotation=5GJWNHPU))
