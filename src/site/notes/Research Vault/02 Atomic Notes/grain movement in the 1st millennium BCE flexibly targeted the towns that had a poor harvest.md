“Most 7th- and 6th-century BCE movement of grain instead flexibly targeted whichever towns had suffered a poor harvest that year, thereby providing an integral buffer for the overall maintenance of a constellation of towns across the basin, while ensuring reliable profits for producers and shippers operating in an unpredictable environment blessed with swift information exchange. As a further means of turning a profit, less hardy but higher-status white wheats may have been cash-cropped for discerning consumers. In this respect it is intriguing that while wheat and, to a lesser degree, olives dominated at coastal Selinous, it was barley, fava beans and animal fat that remained the norm in the Sicilian interior, at indigenous Monte Polizzo.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 549](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=515&annotation=VP52JXC6))
