“stone tool discoveries seem to imply that 800,000 years ago hominins crossed 20-30 km (12-20 miles) of sea between Bali (then joined to Java and thence mainland Asia) and Fombok (attached to other islands extending eastward to Flores).” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 94](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=91&annotation=GVKWHJ5U))

“Without finds of stone tools made of materials only available on the other side, or parallel technologies not explicable by convergence of ideas, the Gibraltar option hovers short of confirmation or refutation.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 95](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=92&annotation=LF6BVZH2))
