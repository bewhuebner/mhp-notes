“In addition to quintessentially Nubian luxury goods and a few imports from Canaan, many of the tombs at Qustul included among their associated artifacts either Egyptian imports or objects exhibiting a similar iconographic vocabulary. The famous Qustul incense burner, discovered in the very largest of the Qustul graves (L24), provides the most interesting example of the latter category. This quintessentially Nubian object bore a carved representation of a king wearing the “white crown,” which would later characterize Upper Egypt, traveling toward a niched palace façade in a high‐prowed boat. The king appears in the company of the Horus falcon, a bound prisoner, and a rosette, reminiscent of the rosettes witnessed on the Narmer Palette and Macehead (see Figure 1.3a and c). The style in which this southern ruler was portrayed would not have been out of place in Upper Egypt and suggests that prior to Qustul’s destruction, it and Abydos constituted each other’s most prestigious peers.” ([Morris, 2018, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/JDKXRVLF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T6H4DPKC?page=32&annotation=VTJHIP2D))
