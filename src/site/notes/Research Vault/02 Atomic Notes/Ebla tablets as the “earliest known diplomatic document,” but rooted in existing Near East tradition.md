“Although this letter is often heralded as the earliest known diplomatic document, it does not mark the first invention of diplomacy. These men knew what they were doing and must have learned the ropes from diplomats who had come before them. Obviously the two kings (or at least their envoys) had been in contact before; this wasn’t a letter wondering whether the two kingdoms might set up an alliance but an exchange between established “brothers.”” ([Podany, 2012, p. 27](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=52&annotation=J5T6WLZD))
