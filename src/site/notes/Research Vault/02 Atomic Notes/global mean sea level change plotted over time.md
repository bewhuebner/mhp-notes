“Since the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), significant volumes of meltwater have been released into the global oceans as a consequence of ice sheets melting, resulting in a global sea-level rise of about 120 m (Fairbanks, 1989; Edwards, 2006; Clark et al., 2009). Sea level rose during the period between 19 ka – 7000 BP by a mean rate of 10 mm/yr. Although the rise is measured generally to have been consistent and sustained, at least two major punctuated episodes of ice melting are known. The first significant addition of meltwater may have started about 19 ka when ocean levels rose 10–15 m in less than 500 years (Clark et al., 2004).” ([Benjamin et al., 2017, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/I3N2SXXH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PTNVIPHE?page=15&annotation=KW2P4EP8))

“The last deglaciation was interrupted by the Younger Dryas event, which began approximately 12.8 ka. In this short interval, until 11.7 ka, the rate of sea-level rise slowed, as documented in Tahiti (Bard et al., 1996, 2010), the Huon Peninsula, New Guinea (Edwards et al., 1993; Cutler et al., 2003), Vanuatu (Cabioch et al., 2003), and Barbados (Peltier and Fairbanks, 2006), consistent with the overall cooling in the Northern Hemisphere.” ([Benjamin et al., 2017, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/I3N2SXXH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PTNVIPHE?page=15&annotation=ZYU3L6JP))

“Changes in sea levels within the Mediterranean region have recently been described by van Andel (1989); and changes in climate have been discussed by Mantzourani and Theodorou (1989), and by Pryor (1995). Their combined views may be summarized: 

- *Fifteenth-eleventh millennium BC*
	- A time of lowest sea levels within the last glaciation. Levels were some 65-70 fathoms (120-130 m) below today's.
- *Twelfth-eighth millennium BC*
	- Rapid rise in sea level causing the flooding of coastal plains, and the isolation of islands. By the eighth millennium BC, the Mediterranean coastline had just about assumed its present configuration.
- Seventh and sixth millennium BC* 
	- Increasing temperature s and precipitation . The rate of sea level rise markedly decreased, with the sea level within 3 fathoms (5.5m) of today's sea level.
- *Fifth and fourth millennium BC (5000-3000 BC)*
	- Temperatures a little higher than today; precipitation greater. Sea level still rising slowly.
- *Third and second millennium BC (3000-1000 BC)*
	- At first drier and hotter summers, and wetter winters. Later a fall in temperature to around today's values. Oscillations around a very slowly rising sea level led to a level close to today's.
- *First millennium BC and first millennium AD* 
	- At first cooler, then warmer from 300 BC-AD 400. Warmer again in the tenth to thirteenth centuries. A 'mini-ice age' in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, followed by slight oscillations to the present (Pryor, 1995: 206-7).” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 89](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=89&annotation=W48KBZTJ))
