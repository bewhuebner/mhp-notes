“Most goods and people still circulated widely, and in all manner of hulls, and those that did not seem to have fallen victim not to trade bans but out-competition, or trouble at their point of origin (naturally, east Phoenician trade went into steep pan-Mediterranean decline). Only in the later 6th century BCE did Carthage endeavour to close the western seas to others, making a treaty with Rome, later its mortal enemy, that attempted to exclude all non-Carthaginian boats from the zone west of Cape Bon in Tunisia. But even allowing for the bigger naval forces and well-monitored ports that we shall shortly encounter, there must be a strong suspicion that efforts to legislate over the sea were only gradually starting to gain more traction than during the Bronze Age.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 547](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=513&annotation=I5SGVTXR))
