“In ancient Egypt, symbolic watercraft, bulls, thrones, and kings depicted on objects dating to the wet phase of c. 3500 B.C. demonstrate a firmly established ideology. These same symbols appear early in Nubia as well, suggesting that interaction with Nubia may have influenced the very conceptualization of Egyptian society. According to Bruce Williams, Nubian artifacts imitate Egyptian Amratian/Naqada I styles, but during Naqada II and III, local materials and styles displace Egyptian features at Qustul, near the modern border between Egypt and Sudan. At Qustul, symbols of kingship such as the serekh (palace facade), falcon, feline deity, royal ship, throne, and the crown were used before their adoption in Egypt. Williams notes that it was only after Aha's Dynasty 1 Nubian campaign that Nubia began to follow Egypt's lead once more. Ward has pointed out that the Egyptian language demonstrates a mixture of Semitic-African influences with a Semitic "super-stratum" heavily overlaid with African traits.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=16&annotation=6IJC3LSX))
