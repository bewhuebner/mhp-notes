“Boards of regular thickness in predynastic coffins provide us with the first physical evidence of woodworking skills, but their thinness suggests considerable experience had already been accumulated. Because the graves with the most wood also contained the greatest number of artifacts, we can view the inclusion of worked wood as another indication of status and rank, foreshadowing the domination of material resource by the state in later times. By the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period, woodworkers had developed a number of fastening techniques, probably facilitated by the use of metal tools, that became standard in the repertoire of both carpentry and shipbuilding. Tarkhan coffins and planks from graves document these traditions and furnish valuable tools for thinking about ways early Egyptian hulls could have utilized existing woodworking technology.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=47&annotation=7TKVLCQ2))
