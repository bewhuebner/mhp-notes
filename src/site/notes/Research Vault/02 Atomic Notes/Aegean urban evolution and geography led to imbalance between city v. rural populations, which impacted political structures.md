“This second cycle of Aegean urbanism bred larger towns but, with a few exceptions, smaller territories, thereby creating unusually high, often evenly balanced, ratios of town-dwellers to country-folk, and commensurately initially under-inhabited rural landscapes, even as reviving population densities broke through their previous Bronze Age records. The houses, temples and other edifices of mercantile Corinth, at this stage the only major walled town in the Aegean, extended amidst intervening fields over 400 ha (1000 acres) below the looming acropolis, but drew upon only 900 sq. km (350 sq. miles) of terrestrial hinterland. To the south, Argos, Bronze Age Mycenae’s heir, held less again. Athens had grown to 20,000 people by 500 BCE, and provides the best examples of courtyard-centred elite town houses (finally, a return for the Aegean to the standards of the Minoan palatial phase), but even so struggled to extend its grip beyond Attica towards its closest overland and island neighbours.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 540-41](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=507&annotation=ZISVHCDA))

“At the apex of most later 7th- and 6th-century Mediterranean city-states in terms of wealth, authority and office stood a restricted group of powerful citizens, less formally organized and overtly hegemonic in their way of running things than the Bronze Age palatial elites. Oligarchy in various forms was therefore the rule, regardless of the niceties – after all, aristocracy (notionally rule by the best) was simply a self-regarding gloss on this basic norm, while the Tyrants’, such as Periander of Corinth, Polycrates of Samos and Athens’s Peisistratids, who arose from about 650 BCE, were commonly oligarchs who had broken their peers’ rule of collective authority. Among the few instances of kingship, Sparta’s was heavily hedged, while those reported by later writers in Etruria and Rome were short-lived, hard to distinguish from tyranny and are barely visible archaeologically.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=507&annotation=IGKERTE2))
