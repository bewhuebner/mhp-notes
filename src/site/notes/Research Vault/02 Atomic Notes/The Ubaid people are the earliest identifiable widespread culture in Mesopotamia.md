“In archaeology, the Proto-Euphrateans are known as the Ubaid people, that is, the people responsible for the cultural remains first unearthed in the tell known as al-Ubaid not far from Ur and later in the very lowest levels of a number of tells throughout ancient Sumer.” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=41&annotation=TYXZBJGI))

“Tell al-Ubaid Tell al-Ubaid was once a prosperous Sumerian city on the Euphrates 3.5 miles west of Ur. Like ancient Tutub (modern Khafaje), Tell Ubaid possessed a temple set on a terrace enclosed within an oval wall. The temple was dedicated in 2500 B.C.E. to Ninhursag, the Sumerian goddess of childbirth. Guarding the entranceway were eight fierce copper-skinned lions with shining, inlaid eyes. On the façade of the temple over its door hung an eight-foot-wide frieze hammered out of copper that showed a lionheaded eagle with wings outspread and flanked by antlered stags. Columns stood to either side, coated with black bitumen and inlaid with contrasting triangles of red limestone and mother-of-pearl, while the walls bloomed with an appliqué of flowers made of clay—altogether the most elaborate decoration to survive from any Sumerian temple. Less imposing but no less informative is another frieze, inlaid with shells, that shows the milking of cows, one of the mainstays of the community’s economy. From the early pottery of Tell al-Ubaid, which resembles the pottery of other sites of the same era, archaeologists developed the term “Ubaid” to describe the art and culture of Mesopotamia during the millennium and a half before 4000 B.C.E.” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 32](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=45&annotation=Z76C4VTY))
