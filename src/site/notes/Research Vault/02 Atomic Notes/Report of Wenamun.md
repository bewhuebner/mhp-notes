“Dor at the time of the [[Research Vault/02 Atomic Notes/Report of Wenamun\|Report of Wenamun]] was written was then already graced with a 35-m (115-ft) built quay, a century or two old when Wenamun docked, and now (in northern Israel) the oldest to survive in the Mediterranean.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 445](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=413&annotation=LVIK9P9A))

“Even allowing for its mixed genres and the standard Egyptian trope of the tribulations of life abroad, the [[Research Vault/02 Atomic Notes/Report of Wenamun\|Report of Wenamun]] is one of those treasuries of incidental detail that irradiate early Mediterranean history. We learn, for example, that the god travelled with his emissary, as Amun-on-the-road, presumably embodied in a figurine akin to that found on the [[Encyclopedia/06 Ships/Uluburun shipwreck\|Uluburun shipwreck]].” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 446](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=414&annotation=RRQPHDMB))
