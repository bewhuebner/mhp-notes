“Elite culture’s definition was made easier by the simplification of its opposite, but still required further strategies that explain many of its details. Use of materials far beyond the ability of ordinary people to obtain was one option. Lapis lazuli, whose source lay in the distant highlands straddling the borders of Afghanistan and Pakistan, is an excellent example. Its deep blue became synonymous in Mesopotamia with fabulous riches, gods, royal heroes like Gilgamesh, and lustrous dark hair (in a distant echo of this, the curly locks of Homer’s gods were still true blue), and in Egypt with regeneration and the night sky. The queen’s name in one Jazira town translates as ‘lapis lazuli girl’. But there were other means of distinction. One was quantitative, evident in gargantuan buildings scaled up from humble predecessors,” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 278](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=255&annotation=QAMCIVQ7))
