“That this cluster of processes draws our focus away from the Levant signals a major evidentiary and historical shift in the primacy of this hitherto key region. The overwhelming bias in its favour, in terms of the privileged insights offered by written records, is abruptly reversed, save for the Old Testament, by a flood of texts emanating from the Aegean. By the 6th century BCE, writing was widespread there and, thanks to the later reverence for Greek culture, huge amounts survive in transmission beyond that on archaeologically durable media. In addition to poetry, dedications, laws, mathematics and philosophy – all touched upon later – Hecataeus, the first known name in a line of historians with a geographical bent, was born at Miletus around 530 BCE. His works do not survive, but those of Herodotus, born a mere forty-six years later, do, and like those of his successor, Thucydides, they probed back into the centuries that concern us in this chapter. This creates the impression of a much more Hellenocentric Mediterranean than was yet the case, and drowns out, whether by ignorance or design, a multitude of other voices and memories.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 536](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=502&annotation=NAXGPRQZ))
