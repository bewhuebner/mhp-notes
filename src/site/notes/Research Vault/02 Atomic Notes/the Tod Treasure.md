“Under the temple of Montu at Tod, well up the Nile, the selfsame pharaoh dedicated four copper chests filled with gold ingots, cups and flowers, silver ingots and 150 carefully folded silver cups and other vessels decorated in styles reminiscent of the Aegean or Anatolia, plus lapis lazuli and other fine stones, seals and scarabs. The [[Tod treasure\|Tod treasure]] confirms where some of the wealth acquired via Mediterranean expeditions ended up, and reminds us that, especially in Egypt, temples too were consumers on a grand scale.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 360](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=336&annotation=K5X7HTKU))

In the temple of Djerty, near Thebes, which had been ransacked by rebels and restored during the reign of Senusret I, four copper chests were uncovered, hidden in the foundations. Each was engraved with the name of Amenemhat II, and together they contained a fabulous treasure: beads, seals, and uncut pieces of lapis lazuli; ingots, chains, a model lion, and cups, all of silver; ingots and vessels of pure gold. The hoard remains one of the richest discoveries ever made in the Nile Valley. But it was not just the wealth of the horde that excited attention. The trade networks it represented were equally impressive. The lapis lazuli came from Mesopotamia and the distant mines of Badakhshan, while the silver cups were of Minoan design and must have come from Crete or a Minoan mercantile community in Syria.
