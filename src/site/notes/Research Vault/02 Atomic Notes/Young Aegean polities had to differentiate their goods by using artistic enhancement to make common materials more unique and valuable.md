“From this observation we can venture a more general proposal about the way in which young Aegean polities, first on Crete and later the islands and mainland too, managed to participate against the odds, and with a semblance of parity, within an east Mediterranean world in which the rules of the game and values of most cards had been determined long before by other players, in which the only high card that some Aegean people held was silver, and in which the Aegean sat so far from the table that the bidding was barely audible. For the finer realms of Aegean production focused ruthlessly on increasing the value of humble local raw materials, not just from clay to decorated pottery, but wool to dazzling textiles and grapes and olives to wine and perfumed oil. Even in metal, virtuoso embellishment is extraordinarily apparent. Of course, the Fevant (which sat practically on the card table itself), as well as Cyprus, pursued similar approaches, and the texts, images and surviving masterpieces of the east deny any claim that fine crafting was an Aegean monopoly. Yet nowhere else did so much depend on it. Not for nothing did later Ugaritic myth place the god of crafts not in any random exotic location, but specifically in Crete.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 381](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=357&annotation=78KBKDFW))
