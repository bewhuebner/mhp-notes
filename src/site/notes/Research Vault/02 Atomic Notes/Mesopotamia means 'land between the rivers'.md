p. 58 - “The [[Nile\|Nile]] is a river between two deserts, Mesopotamia is, according to its Greek name, a land “between the rivers.” The Euphrates and Tigris are turbulent streams fed by the snowmelt from the Taurus Mountains of Asia Minor and the Zagros Mountains of western Iran, and prone to chaotic flooding in their lower reaches. About 160 kilometers from the [[Persian Gulf\|Persian Gulf]] the rivers merge to form the Shatt al-Arab, a marshland that separated the southernmost cities of ancient Mesopotamia from saltwater. Dramatic changes in water levels and currents caused the rivers to meander; some cities once situated on the banks of the rivers are now far from them, while other sites have been wiped out as watercourses twitched across them like a garden hose in geologic time.” ([Paine, 2013, p. 95](zotero://select/library/items/4KTLUL4E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W3B78V8R?page=95&annotation=PUDEISF6)) #etymology

“It was ancient Greek travelers and historians who first gave the land the name by which we know it: Mesopotamia. The name means “the land between the rivers” (from mesos, the Greek word for “between” or “in the middle”; potamos, the Greek word for “river”; and “ia,“ a suffix that the Greeks attached to the names of places).” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=15&annotation=4XRC6ZJN))

“The name “Mesopotamia” is, in fact, a misnomer: many of the land’s ancient cities were located not between the two rivers but just outside the edge of the irregular spearpoint they form as they aim southeast to the sea.” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=17&annotation=CWYZYRF5))
