“The [[Nile\|Delta]] itself, an ever-growing patchwork of solidified land, ponds and marshes among which flowed seven major branches of the Nile and a maze of minor channels, retains almost all of its secrets until after 4000 BCE, under 7—8 m (23—26 ft) of mud. Almost, for a few years ago a small sounding beneath the later town of Sais hit a sandy basal stratum with pots, catfish and deep-channel species, but also Levantine pigs and other domesticates, overlain by another with the four main domestic animals as well as wheat and barley, though still plenty of fish.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 206](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=192&annotation=F3B84SZF))

“At Merimde the accumulation created by a thousand years’ collapse of the flimsy oval huts, and the burial of children within the settlement, encourage us to infer relatively sedentary village life, especially after 4600 BCE, but well-defined houses are hard to discern. Despite Levantine contacts revealed by the incoming domesticates, as well as new spinning and weaving gear, arrows and maceheads, further connections to the south testified by desert stones and possibly cattle, sheep and goats, plus (as we shall see) a two-way trickle via northern Egypt of exotic seashells, Levantine copper and southern gold, communities at the Nile’s junction with the Mediterranean were still rooted on their own deep, and to us archaeologically inaccessible, local past.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 207](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=193&annotation=N8GED8JL))
