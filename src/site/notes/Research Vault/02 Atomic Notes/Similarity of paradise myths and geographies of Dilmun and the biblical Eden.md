“Although our myth deals with a divine, rather than a human, paradise, it has numerous parallels with the Biblical paradise story. In fact, there is some reason to believe that the very idea of a paradise, a garden of the gods, originated with the Sumerians. The Sumerian paradise is located, according to our poem, in [[Encyclopedia/02 Places/Dilmun\|Dilmun]], a land somewhere to the east of Sumer. It is in this same Dilmun that the Babylonians, the Semitic people who conquered the Sumerians, later located their "land of the living," the home of their immortals. And there is good indication that the Biblical paradise, too, which is described as a garden planted eastward in Eden, from whose waters flow the four world rivers, including the Tigris and Euphrates, may have originally been identical with Dilmun, the Sumerian paradise-land.” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 148](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=148&annotation=VE93SZ3B))
