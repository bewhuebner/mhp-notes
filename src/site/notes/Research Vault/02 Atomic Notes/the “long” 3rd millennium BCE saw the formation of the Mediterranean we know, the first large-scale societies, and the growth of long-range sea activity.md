“This chapter investigates what we can usefully conceptualize as the ‘long’ 3rd millennium BCE, a critical time span extending back into the later 4th millennium, and that witnessed four epochal developments. The first was the onset of a drier climate, and so the gradual formation of the Mediterranean environment as we know it today. Twinned with this from birth was the resurgence of desert in the Sahara. The second was the expansion of the first large-scale societies, Egyptian and Mesopotamian, into the easternmost parts of the basin, and their impact on people living there, a turn of events that will require us to consider the role of such influences over a widening area for the remainder of this book. Egypt and Mesopotamia, along with the Indus Valley in Pakistan and China’s Yellow River, comprise the four early foci of such societies over the entirety of Eurasia and Africa, and their proximity to the Mediterranean is a decisive coincidence whose importance for the basin’s subsequent history is hard to exaggerate. Our third development is the appearance of smaller, but no less novel, societies over the northern half of the basin, a phenomenon anticipated in Chapter 6 and now examined in full. The fourth dimension of this crux in Mediterranean history is a boom in long-range activity, especially by sea. Individually vital as each of these undoubtedly was, the ultimate key to understanding the overall transformation of the Mediterranean over the ‘long’ 3rd millennium BCE lies in evaluating the relatedness, or autonomy, of each of these developments relative to the others.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 262](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=239&annotation=R94QRY48))
