“The other well-known and roughly contemporary representation of a boat (sailing boat or otherwise) is on an Egyptian pre-Dynastic vase in the British Museum (Anderson & Anderson 1947: 18; Barnett 1958: 222; Casson 1991: plate 1). Both the Egyptian example and the Mesopotamian vessels commonly appear in the literature on ancient sea-faring as the earliest representations of sailing-boats. There is little doubt that the Egyptian vase depiction represents a sailing-boat, but this essay questions the interpretation of the vessels from Eridu.” ([Strasser, 1996, p. 922](zotero://select/library/items/NBBF3WPV)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7GGSX85?page=3&annotation=Z66UBYRY))
