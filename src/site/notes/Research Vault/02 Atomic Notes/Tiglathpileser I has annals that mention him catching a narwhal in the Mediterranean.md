“Tiglathpileser I (1115–1077 B.C.E.) Active throughout his almost 40-year reign as Assyria’s king, Tiglathpileser I led expedition after expedition against his nation’s enemies on the north, south, and west. He was the first Assyrian king to record and celebrate his victories in chronological annals, and to ideologically justify his conquests. 

His annals are also the first to mention the Aramaeans, a tribe that would remain a thorn in Assyria’s side for centuries to come. In his military campaigns, he defeated King Nebuchadnezzar I of Babylon and marched westward to the Mediterranean, where he went fishing and caught a narwhal, a cross between a dolphin and a swordfish.  

His annals also boasted of his having killed 920 lions, 800 from his chariot and 120 on foot. Back home, he set up a palace library, supervised the codification of Assyrian laws and judicial precedents, and planted foreign and domestic flora in luxurious gardens and parks. The lengthy résumé of this Assyrian Teddy Roosevelt ended when he was murdered and succeeded by a nondescript conspirator.” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 107](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=120&annotation=3EVTJDY7))

### Tiglathpileser I has annals that mention him catching a narwhal in the Mediterranean

“The new power based at Assur is known as ‘Middle Assyrian’ to distinguish it from the Assur of the earlier Anatolian caravan trade and the Neo-Assyrian empire that looms over the end of this chapter and much of the next. Unlike Hatti, it survived as a regional power long enough for its monarch Tiglath-Pileser I (1115–1077 BCE)to spring a tribute- and cedar-extracting visit on the Phoenician ports a decade or so before Wenamun’s journey. There he indulged in a boat cruise to Arwad and boasted of killing a *nahiru* – almost certainly a sperm whale based in the deeps between Cyprus and the Levant, given this sea-creature’s association elsewhere with ivory (Mediterranean scrimshaw, in other words).” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 459](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=426&annotation=DGT5EVWG))
