“Early in the 5th millennium BCE, pit-like copper mines were dug at Ai Bunar in Bulgaria and Rudna Glava in Serbia, just a few days’ walk from the Mediterranean, the first smelting to extract copper from its ore took place at Belovode near Belgrade (currently dated as early as anything equivalent further east), and native gold was panned in streams. Metal items become heavier, technically more sophisticated and more numerous, reaching a temporary peak around 4000 BCE.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 236](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=222&annotation=JZY9KMF3))
