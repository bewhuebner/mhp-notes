### Dilmun as Bahrain

“In the early second millennium BCE, the Old Babylonian period in Mesopotamia, [[Encyclopedia/02 Places/Dilmun\|Dilmun]] was booming. It seems to have grown in importance almost in proportion to the decline of Meluhha and the loss of direct Mesopotamian trade with Magan.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=123&annotation=JK949KK8))

“As in the case of Magan in the twenty-first century BCE, the ships that passed between Dilmun and Mesopotamia now seem to have been Mesopotamian in origin. On the island of Bahrain, archaeological finds show that the influence of Mesopotamia had come to eclipse that of the Indus Valley—no longer were Indus Valley weights and measures used, no longer were Indus inscriptions found, and the few documents that have been excavated in Dilmun were written in cuneiform.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 99](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=124&annotation=ZJLFHCWV))

### Dilmun as Indus Valley Civ

“The land Dilmun, to which we now turn, seems to have been even more intimately related to Sumer than [[Encyclopedia/02 Places/Magan and Meluhha\|Magan and Meluhha]]. [[Encyclopedia/02 Places/Dilmun\|Dilmun]] is identified by most scholars with the island of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf; a large and highly competent Danish archeological expedition has been excavating there for the past ten years largely because of its faith in this identification. As the following analysis of the relevant literary material will show, however, there is considerable room for skepticism on this point. In fact, there is even some possibility that Dilmun may turn out to include the region in Pakistan and India where a remarkable urban, literate culture flourished toward the end of the third millennium B.C., the so-called Harappan, or Indus Valley, culture.” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 281](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=281&annotation=N7V775GQ))
