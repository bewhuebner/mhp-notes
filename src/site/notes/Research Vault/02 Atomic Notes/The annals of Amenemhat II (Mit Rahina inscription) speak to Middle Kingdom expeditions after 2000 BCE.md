“At the Mediterranean interface two features stand out. One was the resumption of the Old Kingdom tradition of royally sponsored sea-trading and raiding, especially to the central and north Levant. A discovery at Memphis provides superb insights into such expeditions. Inscribed on a granite block later reused as a statue base are sections of the annals of the great Amenemhat II (1911-1877 BCE) , dating to early in his reign, during a spate of largesse perhaps intended to solidify a contentious succession.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 359](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=335&annotation=INB22XQD))

“The [[Mit Rahina inscription\|Mit Rahina inscription]], as it is known, records among other projects two overseas ventures. One, to uncertain northerly destinations, possibly including Cyprus, brought back 1554 captives alongside raw and worked metals, precious stones and other fine goods, including furniture. The second, in two ships, targeted the central Levant and returned with a precisely documented cargo of 231 lengths of Lebanese cedar, 65 captives or otherwise human chattels, 23 kg (50 lbs) silver, 133 kg (293 lbs) bronze, 435 kg (959 lbs) copper, 19 kg (42 lbs) white lead, 37 bronze daggers decorated with gold, silver and ivory, 225 kg (496 lbs) emery and 537 kg (1184 lbs) of other grinding sand, diverse other stones, quantities of oils and resins, spices such as coriander and cinnamon, 73 fig trees and other less identifiable vegetal products. The cargo’s diversity is as striking as the presence of substances we would otherwise hardly imagine. The king’s annals also listed gifts to temples, notables and soldiers.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 360](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=336&annotation=RUQGTSP6))
