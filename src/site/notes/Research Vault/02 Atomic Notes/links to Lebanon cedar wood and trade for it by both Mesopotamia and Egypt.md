Both civilizations knew and envied the forests of cedar and other resinous trees in the Amanus Mountains and Lebanon. Mesopotamian legend had already baptized “the cedar mountain” the “home of the gods.” “There the shade was cool and refreshing” for Gilgamesh, the fabulous hero, and the great tree trunks slid into the rivers “like giant serpents” when Gudea, the priest-king of Lagash, felled them with his great axe to build the temples of his city. An Egyptian traveller fourteen centuries before Christ looked up in amazement at the sky above the forests of Lebanon, “all dark because there grew there so many cypresses, oaks and cedars.” These forests explain the flotillas of sailing boats between Byblos and the Nile Delta, or plying up the Syrian coast to northern ports, towing behind them rafts of timber which would then be transported overland, heedless of cost, to the cities of Mesopotamia. Wood was therefore the reason for the first proper links between Egypt and Syria, for the expeditions to Byblos sent by the Pharaoh Sahura and the “entrepreneurs” of Elephantine. Sargon waged a war over timber from the Mediterranean. ([Location 1409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004FEFSCC&location=1409)) (Braudel 2001, p. 59)
