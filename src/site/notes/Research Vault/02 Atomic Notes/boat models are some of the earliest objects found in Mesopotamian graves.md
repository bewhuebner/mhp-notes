“Model boats are among the earliest objects found in Mesopotamian graves and tombs. From a grave at Eridu dug before 4000 B.C.E. comes the baked clay model of a broad-bottomed sailboat, complete with a socket for a mast; holes fore, aft, and amidships to tie the rigging; and a seat for the sailor to sit on. From a third millennium B.C.E. royal tomb at Ur comes a sleek rowboat crafted from silver with seven rowing benches and oars. Such model boats may have been intended to provide the ghosts of the dead with transportation in the spirit-world, like the more elaborate toy ships found in the treasure-filled tomb of pharaoh Tutankhamun. All these Near Eastern miniatures may also point to something far more mundane but just as illuminating: model-building as an ancient hobby. Additionally, just as Egyptian pieces of jewelry portray the gods sailing on a heavenly Nile, so do Mesopotamian cylinder seals depict the gods traveling in divine ships on similar voyages.” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 252](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=265&annotation=EP3JQ85I))
