“Unlike the Khufu boats, no one has tried to prove that the Dashur boats should be considered as solar boats, and most scholars consider them to be associated with the funeral or burial of the king. No inscriptions or other artifacts from the excavation prove or disprove the relationship with Senwosret III, although popular accounts of the Carnegie boat associate it with a "master of royal watercraft." A basket filled with crude miniature ceramic containers is displayed with the Chicago hull, but there is no solid evidence linking the basket with the excavation of the boats.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 83](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=91&annotation=K7KBQN7B))

“Their shape and decoration suggest that they were funerary boats, intended to be towed by other vessels. Garstang noted that each of eleven Middle Kingdom burials of minor officials at Beni Hasan included a model of a rowing and a sailing boat, and a granary. The idea of two boats interred with a burial can be linked to Khufu I and II and to the Lisht models outside the mastaba tomb of lmhotep. Their importance to the dead person was on a par with the provision of grain-the staple food of ancient Egypt. Other excavations of Dynasty 12 tombs also included two or three model boats: two funerary craft and one boat with solar symbols.

Middle Kingdom models of funerary boats are often painted green or yellow, have striped bulwarks and two steering oars like the Dashur hulls, and have the same 4:1 proportions. Mod- els have often been dismissed as inaccurately reflecting the vessels they mimic, but if proportions are checked, cargo and travelling boats are about 3:1, war or racing hulls are much longer and narrower, and funerary boats are 4:1.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 101](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=109&annotation=PNILIVHE))
