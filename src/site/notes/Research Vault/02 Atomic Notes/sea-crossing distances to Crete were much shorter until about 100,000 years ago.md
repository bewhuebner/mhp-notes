“Sea-crossing distances to Crete over much of the last half million years seem to have been much shorter than at present and, interestingly, in contrast to Crete’s earlier dwarf hippopotami and mammoths, by 150,000-100,000 years ago fossils of normal-sized elephants and mice, as well as several varieties of deer, show that endemism was declining. Potentially, the latter could reflect shoreline changes that eased access for all comers, including hominins, or the ghostly presence of a (hominin?) predator, either way at a comparatively late date.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 95](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=92&annotation=6T9ZXE76))
