you can throw out almost everything we regard as schooling—all the testing, all the assessments, even formal teaching—and still produce people who can read, write, and function in society. This tells you how much of what we are neurotically putting our kids through is pointless (at best). ([Location 4075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093G9TS91&location=4075))
