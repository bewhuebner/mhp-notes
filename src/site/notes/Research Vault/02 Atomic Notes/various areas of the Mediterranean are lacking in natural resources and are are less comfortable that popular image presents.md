We are too inclined to think of Mediterranean life as la dolce vita, effortlessly easy. But we are allowing the charms of the landscape to deceive us. Arable land is scarce there, while arid and infertile mountains are everywhere present (“plenty of bones, not enough meat” as one geographer has put it). Rainfall is unevenly distributed: plentiful when the vegetation is hibernating in winter, it disappears just when plant growth needs it. Wheat, like other annual plants, has to ripen quickly. Human labour is not relieved by the climate: all the heavy work has always had to be done when the summer heat is at its fiercest, and the resulting harvest crop is all too often meagre. Hesiod’s advice in summer was to go “naked to sow, naked to plough, naked to reap,” and Virgil repeated the tag: nudus ara, sere nudus. If the grain is in short supply at the end of the year, he adds, “then shake the oak tree of the forests to satisfy your hunger.” ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004FEFSCC&location=555)) (Braudel 2001, p. 12)
