“To the west, hunter-gatherer lifestyles continued until far later. Farming began in the Aegean around 7000-6500 BCE, contemporary with the Late PPNB boom and its aftermath; at the other end of the basin, it only reached Iberia around 5500 BCE, by which time the Levantine Neolithic was drawing to a close.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 178-79](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=165&annotation=TW9HLN3Q))
