“This brings us back to ‘world-systems’ as a way of understanding the growth of large-scale societies and interregional economies in the Mediterranean (and the rest of Europe) from the 4th to 1st millennia BCE, as raised in Chapter l. This identifies a ‘core’ of urban societies with advanced agriculture and manufacture (initially Mesopotamia and Egypt), a ‘periphery’ of smaller societies (for our purposes initially in adjacent parts of the Mediterranean) engaged in unequal economic and ideological relations with the core, which they supplied with materials, receiving in return trappings of elite culture that bolstered nascent leaders, and a vast outer ‘margin’ of independent societies in which any escaping scraps of core culture lost their original meaning. Expansion was driven by burgeoning consumption at the centre and the tendency for peripheries to be structurally altered by interaction with the core, until they fused with it, driving peripheries and margins ever outward. There is much to recommend this as a schematic way of conceptualizing one of the principal emerging vectors of change in the Mediterranean, albeit in a way different from that in which its participants rationalized their actions, with often much reworking at the receiving ends, and havoc played by the connective possibilities of a central sea on any expectation of concentric zoning.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 283](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=260&annotation=TZTSPX83))
