“Lucius Quinctius [[Cincinnatus\|Cincinnatus]], for example, who more than two millennia later gave his name to the American city of Cincinnati, is supposed to have returned from semi-exile in the 450s BCE to become dictator and lead Roman armies to victory against their enemies before nobly retiring straight back to his farm without seeking further political glory. . . . The farmer who saved the state. This twentieth-century statue from modern Cincinnati shows Cincinnatus returning the symbols of political office and going back to his plough. Many Roman stories presented him in this way as a no-nonsense patriot but there was another side to Cincinnatus, as a die-hard opponent of the rights of the plebeians and of the poor in the city.” ([Location 1835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0108U7IHO&location=1835)) (page 140)
