“At Mersin on the western shore of the Gulf of îskenderun, and below the metal-rich Bolkardag mountains, a remarkable fortification wall with a gate guarded by towers was built around 5000-4800 BCE, and the overlying level saw a tripartite building with storage magazines added; a slight frisson is engendered by the fact that horizons of destruction become frequent. These constitute the first probable examples in the Mediterranean basin of grain storage beyond household levels, and of large-scale defence walls. Sites like Kurdu and Mersin exploited rich farmland in their surrounding plains, but while such niches were fairly widespread in the basin, their architecture and its social implications were not. The explanation must be sought in a wider framework, specifically the advantage that these places enjoyed at the junction between metal-rich Anatolia, the southern Levant, and connections eastward along the grassy saddle of the Jazira into Mesopotamia.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 240-41](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=226&annotation=DWATUBEB))
