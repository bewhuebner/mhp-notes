#### Darnell 2015

“The scenes and the hieroglyphic annotation together reveal that the Nag el-Hamdulab cycle relates to the Following of Horus in what at the time would have been a still somewhat ill-defined border area between pharaonic Egypt and A-Group Nubia. The images of the Nag el-Hamdulab cycle provide further evidence for an association of solar-Sokarian vessels with First Dynasty royal ritual, and for a connection between those vessels and the activities of a royal nautical festival, perhaps an element of the Jubilee.” ([Coleman Darnell, 2015, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/8JW3W4KT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JLTCXU3T?page=3&annotation=7JHLR6GV))

“no larger or more visually central or dominant than other participants in the activities depicted, as in the decoration on the Gebelein Linen (Donadoni Roveri, D’Amicone & Leospo 1994: 21-22, figs. 4-7), the images of the Hierakonpolis Tomb 100 cycle (Quibell & Green 1902: pls. 75-79), and the early Protodynastic memorial tableau at Gebel Tjauti in the Theban Western Desert (Friedman, Hendrickx, with Darnell, in Darnell et al. 2002: 10-19 and pls. 9-11). A change occurs at the dawn of the dynastic age, however, and the ruler with crown and regalia assumes a more central position, repeated within the various segments of a larger cycle of images—as in the imagery so common in the temples of dynastic Egypt, iconographically the true pharaoh could indeed be in multiple places at one time.” ([Coleman Darnell, 2015, p. 22](zotero://select/library/items/8JW3W4KT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JLTCXU3T?page=4&annotation=BAX5MIMP))

“The Nag el-Hamdulab cycle is the earliest depiction in the by then well-established line of images that belong to scenes of royal navigation—perhaps more specifically the Jubilee cycle (Williams & Logan 1987; Leblanc 2011)—to bear an accompanying hieroglyphic annotation. The brief Hamdulab early hieroglyphic text is consistent with known Archaic hieroglyphic inscriptions, and the closest parallels for an Early Dynastic navigation with early hieroglyphic annotation are the twin annotated rock inscription images of a boat carrying a smaller vessel in the Wadi of the Horus Qa-a, northwest of Luxor, dating probably to the reign of Qa-a at the end of the First Dynasty (Darnell 2009: 102-103; 2011). In these scenes of royal navigation with early hieroglyphic annotations—the Nag el-Hamdulab tableau and the two scenes from the Wadi of the Horus Qa-a—vessels associated with Sokar are present, in the Hamdulab scenes boats like the later @nw-bark, in the Qa-a Wadi images the Maaty-bark.” ([Coleman Darnell, 2015, p. 35](zotero://select/library/items/8JW3W4KT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JLTCXU3T?page=17&annotation=5HP9EUCY))

“==The appearance of the first of the small, Upper Egyptian step pyramids coincides with the cessation of the perambulating Following of Horus visits (Dreyer & Kaiser 1980: 56-59; Gundlach 1994: 70; Redford 1986: 89), and represents an anchoring of the royal cult (Seidlmayer 1996: 123-124; Wilkinson 1999: 277-279), and associated economic aspects thereof, within the greater Egyptian landscape.== The Elephantine complex of ritual and economic activity, with manifestation of royal authority, roughly corresponds temporally to the great changes in provincial administration and agricultural domains under Snofru (Moreno Garcia 1999: 235 et passim), and may directly have replaced the activities that appear in the Nag el-Hamdulab cycle.” ([Coleman Darnell, 2015, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/8JW3W4KT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JLTCXU3T?page=19&annotation=WU7F4VPC))

#### Hendrickx 2012

“The Nag el-Hamdulab cycle may be said to show the emergence of the ruler as supreme human priest and incarnate manifestation of human and divine power. The Nag el-Hamdulab cycle is also the first complex iconographic composition with accompanying hieroglyphic annotation.  

That text refers to the ‘Nautical Following (of Horus)’, the biennial progress of the royal court on a perambulating judicial and tax-collecting visit to demonstrate royal authority throughout the land, and may therefore be the earliest record of tax collection we have from Egypt, and the first expression of royal economic control over Egypt and most probably also Nubia.” ([Hendrickx et al., 2012, pp. 1,082](zotero://select/library/items/EWJ5D5I4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U49CD5KL?page=15&annotation=K6A582J5))

“The final element of the first tableau at site 7 is a four-sign hieroglyphic inscription immediately behind the stern of the uppermost boat and above the prow of the final vessel (Figure 11). The hieroglyphs are fully pecked in the style of the images of the tableaux, possess the same degree of patination, and are certainly elements of the tableau. Palaeographically of Early Dynastic date, the annotation refers to a ‘nautical following’ and appears to label the imagery—and apparently the entirety of the Nag el-Hamdulab cycle—as ultimately related to the royal and ritual event known as the ‘Following of Horus’, the biennial judicial and tax-collecting perambulation of the royal court as demonstration of royal authority, here further related to a toponym that unfortunately cannot be located (cf. Wilkinson 1999: 220–21).” ([Hendrickx et al., 2012, pp. 1,081](zotero://select/library/items/EWJ5D5I4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U49CD5KL?page=14&annotation=TSLHBLE8))
