“The Indus Valley—known as Meluhha—had a profound influence on [[Encyclopedia/02 Places/Dilmun\|Dilmun]] in the third millennium. By the twenty-first century BCE, the traders in Dilmun mostly used the Indus Valley system of weights and measures and carried square Indus Valley seals to mark their property rather than Mesopotamian cylinder seals.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=71&annotation=4SRPQYVE))

“most cuneiformists agree that by the first millennium B.C. Magan and Meluhha did correspond roughly to Egypt and Ethiopia. It is for the earlier periods—for the days of [[Encyclopedia/01 People/Sargon of Akkad\|Sargon]] the Great, [[Gudea\|Gudea]], and the Third Dynasty of Ur, for example—that this identification has been generally thought to be most unlikely, since it would involve the seemingly incredible assumption that the peoples of those early days had seagoing ships that could reach the east coast of Africa. This has led to the hypothesis that over the millenniums there was a shift in toponymy, that is, that in the third and second millenniums B.C. the names[[Encyclopedia/02 Places/Magan and Meluhha\|Magan and Meluhha]] corresponded to the lands bordering the east and southeast Arabian coasts but that for one reason or another these names were later transferred to Egypt and Ethiopia.” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 276](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=276&annotation=QZBPLXQ5))
