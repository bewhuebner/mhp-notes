“The major exchange arenas that emerge are the Aegean, parts of the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian sub-basins (the last two only feebly linked across peninsular Italy), and a corridor centred on southern France, extending west into Catalonia and east towards the Po. The maritime nature of most of these zones is striking, and testimony to the integrative role of populated islands. But the degree of overland or coastwise linkage between the Rhone and Ebro is also marked, in fact more so than at any subsequent time until the 1st millennium BCE.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 230](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=216&annotation=G7XHE3YX))
