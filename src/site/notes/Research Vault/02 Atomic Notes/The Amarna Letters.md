“Our next window looks out from a royal balcony in Akhetaten, the capital temporarily established in the mid-14th century BCE at Amarna, halfway between Thebes and Memphis, by Amenhotep III’s son, the famous revisionist pharaoh Akhenaten (1352-1336 BCE) . It consists of the correspondence sent to Egypt at the zenith of its power by other major and lesser polities, independent and vassal, over the course of thirty years. Interstate communication via emissaries and letters goes back to the early 2nd millennium BCE in this part of the world, and the resultant alliances and accords had long institutionalized and facilitated flows of goods between regions. The Amarna archive reflects the formalization of such procedures into a new species of international relations that flourished over a lengthier period (from the 15th to 13th centuries BCE), and arguably the world’s first diplomacy. The letters are formulaic documents written in versions of Akkadian, already a dead language akin in its use as a universal tongue to medieval Latin.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 396](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=372&annotation=52I5ZH5J))

“The Amarna letters, which were found in the late nineteenth century at the site of Amarna in Egypt. Just forty-four of them pertain to international interactions, mostly between the great powers; the other 306 had passed between the pharaoh and his vassals in Canaan. Of the forty-four international letters, three are almost completely illegible, thirteen are from kings of Mittani to kings of Egypt, eleven are from Babylonia to Egypt, seven are from Alashiya (Cyprus) to Egypt, three are from Hatti to Egypt, two are from Assyria to Egypt, and one is from Arzawa (a kingdom near Hatti) to Egypt. Just four are copies of letters that the pharaoh sent to other kings (one to Arzawa, three to Babylon)” ([Podany, 2012, p. 186](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=211&annotation=9IYKEH9Q))

##### the Amarna Letters as the window into international diplomacy as an innovation

“Here is one of the great innovations of human history—diplomacy on a truly international scale, when major kings chose not to fight but to seek peace, and created all the necessary protocols and instruments for diplomatic solutions to international problems—and all that we have is an almost random selection of forty-four of the documents that passed between the kings who benefi ted from this new idea. They are documents that don’t even come from the beginning of the era, letters without answers, pregnant with implications but short on political history.  

And yet, taken along with other contemporary evidence—including inscriptions, treaties, contracts, and archaeological sites—they make it possible to peer into the world that created them. They show that the diplomatic system that had been developing ever since the time of the kings of Ebla found its greatest realization in this new brotherhood of great kings. No longer were the alliances designed to strengthen a king’s hand as he prepared for war, or even to help him find a way to avoid war. The alliances and the close connections they created between brother kings had become an end in themselves.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 187](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=212&annotation=GBDUYVBB))

“The era that encompassed Amenhotep III’s reign and that of his son Akhenaten is known as the Amarna period. It was a time of unprecedented international cooperation.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 191](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=216&annotation=GWJYRSJ8))

“The brotherhood of great kings, through much of Amenhotep III’s reign, probably only included Egypt, Mittani, and Babylonia. Hatti had been a great power before and would become one again, but it was going through a period of weakness. No letters were found at Amarna that had been sent between the king of Hatti and Amenhotep III, and the pharaoh wrote at one point, “I have heard that everything is finished and the country Hattusa is shattered.” Amenhotep III also corresponded with kings in Alashiya (Cyprus) and Arzawa (in western Anatolia), but they were not at the same level of power and importance as Babylonia and Mittani.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 191](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=216&annotation=8YTWIJEU))

“Amenhotep seemed to have had an insatiable desire for foreign wives. In fact, all of the letters from Amenhotep III, as well as many of the quotes attributed to him in other letters, were at least in part about women.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 194](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=219&annotation=RB6XNMTY))

##### The consistent “Bickering” Tone in the Amarna Letters

“The kings did have a tendency to argue. Many, if not most, of the Amarna letters between the great kings had an angry tone to them.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 207](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=232&annotation=2MEE89SG))

##### Diplomatic Marriages in the Amarna Letters

“It would be hard to overstate the centrality of diplomatic marriages in international relationships by this time. The Amarna letters give us much more information about these marriages than we have for any other period of ancient Near Eastern history. The letters provide fascinating details: the stages of the negotiations, the vast quantity of gifts exchanged, the kings’ emotions and strategies, and even the words of one princess before her marriage. It does seem that an alliance wasn’t seen as entirely complete until the kings were related by marriage, as true family members, not just fictitious “brothers.” At that point, they said, their lands were united.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 217](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=242&annotation=7CVKJ397))

“The 1,200 minas of gold weren’t in bullion, though. They were fashioned into hundreds of objects, including jewelry, goblets, containers, boxes, and knives, along with much larger gold-plated items: four chariots, two beds, six thrones, three chairs, and even “one ship, of cedar, overlaid with gold, along with all its gear, and six small ships that one tows.” These seem to have been full-size ships that could be sailed on the river. They must have been dismantled for transport to Babylonia, since there was no way to sail there.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 220](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=245&annotation=8AN4KQ9Z))

“Gifts had always been important in diplomatic correspondence, but by the time of the Amarna letters it almost seemed as though the alliances existed solely so that the kings could acquire luxury goods. This wasn’t the case— there were many other reasons for alliances to flourish—but the allure of exotic wares that were unavailable at home was powerful. Just about every letter was accompanied by valuable presents.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 244](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=269&annotation=EASJTMAN))

“But there was another kind of gift as well, one that caused much more anxiety. Such gifts involved significant quantities of raw materials that had, for all practical purposes, been ordered by a king from his ally with the promise that a shipment of a local product on a similar scale would be sent in return. Most of the Amarna letters that mention such large shipments pertained to unworked gold from Egypt, but it’s likely that other goods, such as silver, copper, and horses, might have been viewed in a similar way and requested from other kings.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 245](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=270&annotation=Q7UJKZ7G))

“In eleven of the Amarna letters, the leaders of the great powers wrote to the pharaoh to request “much gold.” They almost all did it—Tushratta of Mittani, Kadashman-Enlil I and then Burna-buriash II of Babylonia, Ashur-uballit of Assyria, and even a Hittite prince. Why did they want all this gold? It was always for a good reason, they protested. Vital building projects were in the works, and gold was simply essential. In one letter, Burna-buriash II of Babylonia virtually demanded gold for a temple that he was building: “At the moment my work on a temple is extensive, and I am quite busy with carrying it out. Send me much gold.”” ([Podany, 2012, p. 247](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=272&annotation=JXCCHWLB))

“The Egyptian kings seem rarely if ever to have satisfied their allies’ desire for gold for their building projects.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 249](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=274&annotation=ZFYSLGPK))

“Amenhotep III had only one real request when writing to most of the great kings: he wanted to marry their daughters. The greeting gifts that they sent were nice, of course, and Mittanian or Babylonian horses and chariots certainly could come in useful, but it was princesses that he was collecting. 

The same does not seem to have been true of his relationship with Alashiya, the island of Cyprus. Nowhere in the eight letters from the king of Alashiya to Egypt was there any mention of marriage or princesses. The letters were all business, because the Egyptian king wanted something very specific from Alashiya: copper. Egypt needed a lot of copper to make bronze tools, utensils, armor, weapons, and vessels—more copper, apparently, than could be mined within Egypt or the Sinai.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 252](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=277&annotation=CPFDYF83))

“Sailors on a boat traveling north from Egypt to the wealthy port cities of Syria might have seen the hills of Alashiya off to the west, just fifty-seven miles from the coast. Part of the Alashiyan king’s cockiness might have come from his conviction that the king of Egypt wouldn’t stand a chance of adding Alashiya to his empire. The pharaoh had no navy, and his fighters were accustomed to battles in chariots, not boats.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 253](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=278&annotation=6S5P5NMV))

“We’re left with a bit of a mystery surrounding this unnamed king. Alashiya was just an island state, not an empire like Egypt, Mittani, or Hatti or a major kingdom like Babylonia. The pharaoh doesn’t seem to have objected to being called “brother” by the king of Alashiya, but this man was not a member of the great king brotherhood. In some ways, he seems to have been a bit of a loose cannon: unfriendly, accusatory, but then promptly conciliatory as well, and surprisingly uninformed on the luxury goods available in the home of his ally.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 255](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=280&annotation=VW8VGKWL))

“The Hittite kings mentioned many minor kingdoms in their records; western Anatolia was littered with them. One of these kingdoms has intrigued scholars for decades: it was called Ahhiya or Ahhiyawa, and it showed up in a few Hittite records from the early fourteenth to the late thirteenth century. It seems that it wasn’t within Anatolia; one had to go by sea to get there. Sometimes the Ahhiyawan leaders were allied with the Hittites; at other times they were helping with rebellions against the Hittites. Their history is impossibly spotty; it has been pulled together from fragmentary references in just a couple of dozen texts. But that name—Ahhiyawa. To the people who first deciphered Hittite texts, it looked a little like Achaea, one of the ancient names for Greece, and it still does. In fact, most scholars now think that Ahhiyawa was Greek.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 261](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=286&annotation=LZC93ETC))

“It wasn’t a great power, not on the scale of Hatti, Babylonia, Assyria, or Egypt, but it played an important role in the politics and economics of the eastern Mediterranean region. Ahhiyawa seems even to have participated in the usual gift exchanges. One letter to Hattusili III mentioned “the gift of the king of Ahhiyawa.” If it turns out that the Greeks were participants in the diplomatic system and some cuneiform letters are eventually found at one of the palaces in Mycenaean Greece, or if a letter from an Ahhiyawan king is found in Egypt or one of the other great powers, then we’ll know much more. For now, Ahhiyawa is an intriguing side note to the story of the brotherhood of great kings.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 262](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=287&annotation=JECGXHKZ))

#### Wilkinson

Closer to home, diplomacy was an essential tool for maintaining Egypt’s imperial conquests in the Near East. Thanks to a remarkable discovery made in A.D. 1887, the relations among Egypt, its vassals, and the other great powers of the day have been revealed in all their internecine complexity. The Amarna Letters are an archive of official correspondence found among the ruins of the “house of correspondence of the pharaoh” (the secretariat of the ancient Egyptian foreign ministry). The 380 surviving documents are in the form of baked clay tablets. They are written in the cuneiform (wedge-shaped) script of Mesopotamia, and in the Babylonian language of Bronze Age diplomacy. Many date to the latter years of Amenhotep III’s reign and were sent by vassal princes to the Egyptian pharaoh, whom they addressed with suitable obeisance as “my sun, my lord.” ([Location 4063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004FGMZAI&location=4063))(Wilkinson 2010, p. 245)
