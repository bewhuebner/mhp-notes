“The importance of water transportation to Mesopotamia is evident in the Code of Hammurabi, where seven statutes apply to boats and boating. The code sets the price for caulking a boat as well as the penalty for not doing so properly. In addition, it sets the wage for a boatman and the punishment to be meted out for any accidents resulting from his carelessness.” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 253](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=266&annotation=FAICHMQE))
