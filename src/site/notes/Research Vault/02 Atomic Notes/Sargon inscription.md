“30 SARGON (tablet) 
Sargon, the king of Kish, triumphed in thirty-four battles (over the cities) up to the edge of the sea (and) destroyed their walls. He made the ships from Meluhha, the ships from Magan, (and) the ships from [[Encyclopedia/02 Places/Dilmun\|Dilmun]] tie up alongside the quay of Agade. Sargon, the king, prostrated himself before Dagan (and) made supplication to him; (and) he (Dagan) gave him the upper land, (namely) Mari, Yarmuti, (and) Ibla, up to the Cedar Forest (and) up to the Silver Mountain. Sargon, the king, to whom Enlil permitted no rival—5,400 warriors ate bread daily before him. Whoever destroys this inscription—may An destroy his name; may Enlil exterminate his seed; may Inanna” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 324](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=324&annotation=B8L2XDUU))
