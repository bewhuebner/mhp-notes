“In a timberless country like Egypt, and ages before the importation of cedar from Syria was possible, the natives who inhabited the vast marsh-land of the Nile, then little better than a tropical jungle, must have devised such floats as these with which to cross the river at need. They called each bundle an "armful," for we cannot doubt that the name shn for such a reed-float was derived from the verb "to embrace," and the word for the earliest and simplest Nile boat will therefore have been "armful," or in the customary form, the "two armfuls." When we notice that this designation had dropped out of use by 3000 B.C., or at least was not sufficiently common after that date to appear in the monumental records of the Old Kingdom known to us outside the Pyramid Texts, the remote origin of both the name and the device it designated is evident.” ([Breasted, 1917, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/UNIHDJ7X)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DSCT6KYR?page=4&annotation=8V7S64Q8))

==“Interesting evidence that the reed floats were the earliest form of craft on the Nile is furnished by a well-known Old Kingdom term for boat-building. Even the construction of a wooden boat might be called "binding" (I3 spl) a boat, a term which must be derived from the primitive binding of the reed floats. Wooden boats, like other wood work, were certainly already produced on the Nile at a time when only stone tools were available, just as in Europe. The term "binding," designating a process which antedated the wooden boats of the Stone Age, must therefore have arisen far back in the Stone Age, and having become the current term for boat-building at that remote period, was then applied to the process of constructing wooden boats.”== ([Breasted, 1917, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/UNIHDJ7X)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DSCT6KYR?page=5&annotation=TQW46UYA))
