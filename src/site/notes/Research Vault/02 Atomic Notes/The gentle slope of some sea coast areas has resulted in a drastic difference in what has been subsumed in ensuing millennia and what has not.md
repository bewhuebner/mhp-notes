“But in gently sloping areas, the glacial maxima in particular substantially augmented the Mediterranean’s lowlands, to the approximate tune of 300,000-400,000 sq. km (115,000-155,000 sq. miles). These drowned, archaeologically all but inaccessible plains, well watered, probably grazed by game animals and close to the softer climatic influence of the sea as well as the rich diversity of foods in coastal and estuarine landscapes, are widely held to have been magnets for early occupation.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 90](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=87&annotation=SZIZ55DJ))
