“A wealth of further insights into maritime culture can be gleaned from the texts. One, cited earlier, mentions an artificial quay, with which a ship had collided. Another refers to large royal musters of ships in adversity. Mahadu’s overseer spent time in Cyprus buying boats for the king, but other texts establish beyond doubt the existence of private as well as royal vessels. Further tablets set out the regulations that defined the responsibility apportioned to owners, traders and crews for the safety of ships and cargo –we even learn of an unlucky ship that ‘died’ in a terrible storm off Tyre, whose king restored its cargo to the survivors after this had been salvaged and appropriated by a local coastguard. A few texts record specific shipments, most of which, in a healthy antidote to the tendency to gravitate towards spectacular ventures, were modest in size and destined for nearby cities on the Levantine coast; conversely, the inference from one document that giant ships of several hundred tonnes’ capacity existed is flawed.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 393-94](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=370&annotation=9VJGDF5Y))
