“Motya grew throughout the 7th century BCE and by the 6th the entire islet was circled with defensive walls, joined by a mole to the main island of Sicily, and densely packed with warehouses, shrines, a tophet, a *cothon* harbour and housing for some 15,000 inhabitants. In its industrial quarters, murex were crushed on sperm whale vertebrae, one with an iron harpoon tip embedded.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 538](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=504&annotation=V9NHHUN9))
