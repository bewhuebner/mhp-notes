#### Geographically

The situation was not the same as that on the Euphrates: Egypt and Mesopotamia would never be identically placed. The most obvious reason is that Egypt was from the start surrounded by deserts, with arid wastes cutting it off on all sides. It was the increasing dry-ness of the climate which had created Egypt, by intensifying the encroachment of the Saharan sands from the seventh and sixth millennia onwards.

We may perhaps conclude with Maurice Vieyra: “Egypt was a gift from the Nile. Mesopotamia was made by human hands” (1961).

#### Economically

Situated at the meeting point of every route, Mesopotamia was necessarily more open to the outside world, more dynamic than any other region. Its “bourgeois merchants” were to take the first known steps in history down the road marked “capitalism.” I am inclined to think that it was copper, bought in the Bahrain islands, which provided the first impetus for the Sumerian cities. It launched them into the adventure of long-distance trade which, in every age, has been a revolutionary force.
