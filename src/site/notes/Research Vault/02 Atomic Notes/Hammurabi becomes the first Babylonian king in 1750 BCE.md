“To the north, in the previously unimportant city of Babylon, an outstanding Semitic ruler named [[Hammurabi\|Hammurabi]] came to prominence. After some three decades of a rather troubled rule, he attacked and defeated Rim-Sin of Larsa, as well as the kings of Elam, Mari, and Eshnunna, and thus, about 1750 B.C., became the ruler of a united kingdom reaching from the Persian Gulf to the Habur River. With Hammurabi the history of Sumer comes to an end, and the history of Babylonia, a Semitic state built on a Sumerian foundation, begins.” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 72](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=72&annotation=L5HNWZQV))

“The empire that Hammurabi created extended throughout much of what is now Iraq. Perhaps he hoped to be seen as a true successor to Sargon. But having united Mesopotamia into a single realm, Hammurabi took a different turn from Sargon. The earlier king had filled his royal inscriptions with accounts of his military might; Sargon “was victorious in thirty-four campaigns and dismantled (all) the cities, as far as the shore of the sea.” Hammurabi, although he too noted that he was a “peerless warrior,” seems to have wanted more to be seen as “the judicious one,” the one who “shows mercy,” and “provides abundant waters” for the people, “the pious prince” who was “the shepherd of the people,” someone who brought them peace, prosperity, and justice. This may have been one reason why, in the closing years of his reign, he set out his collection of laws and had them inscribed on public monuments.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 90](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=115&annotation=ASL9UKC8))
