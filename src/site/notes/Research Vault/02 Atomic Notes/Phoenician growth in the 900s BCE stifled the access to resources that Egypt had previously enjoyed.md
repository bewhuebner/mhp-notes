“The Delta was still agriculturally wealthy and populous enough to sponsor rare displays of old-style Egyptian power. In about 925 BCE the Libyan-named pharaoh Sheshonq launched a one-off raid into the Levant to disrupt emergent polities there, a traumatic enough event to be remembered in the Bible’s Book of Kings, and to leave a patch of detectable devastation north of Jerusalem. Spoils from this may have contributed to the gold and silver that his successor, Osorkon, claimed to have distributed to Egypt’s gods. But the reality was less unambiguously rosy; the necropolis of Tanis contains Egypt’s largest collection of intact royal burials, but their wealth pales beside that of even the relatively minor Tutankhamun, and like the city’s other monuments, they pressed earlier masterpieces into service. One chronic problem was penetration by Phoenician interests of the production and marketing of metalwork, glazed goods and wine. Alongside Wenamun’s testimony to the Delta potentates’ dependence on Levantine shipping, this plots a growing stranglehold by overseas merchants on trade with the mouth of the Nile.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 498](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=465&annotation=94LKC55J))

“When Osorkon had his name inscribed on a possibly older royal bust that he then dispatched to Byblos in emulation of Old Kingdom practices, it can have done nothing to disguise the true reversal of relations with the Phoenician coast.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 499](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=466&annotation=FPK5QV63))
