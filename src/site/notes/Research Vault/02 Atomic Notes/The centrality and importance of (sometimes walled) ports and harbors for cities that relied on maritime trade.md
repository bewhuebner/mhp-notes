“The apparent paradox that weakly structured polities bereft of overall economic control could enjoy enormous increases in wealth is in part resolved by this critical factor. Sicilian coastal towns in particular made huge profits on the grain, oil and wine trade, not least with Carthage.

Such circumstances placed great economic and regulatory significance on the ports serving such city-states. These became, as in eastern parts of the basin centuries earlier, carefully managed if physically precarious, usually unwalled arenas through which flowed diverse characters, now injected with a further charge by the rivalries and ethnic distinctions that began to inform encounters between people at them. It was probably at this stage that the term ‘emporion’ came into its definitional own to describe such places. The 6th-century growth of Phaleron, Piraeus’s predecessor as the harbour of Athens, was accompanied by the political creation of a *metoikic* (resident foreigner) status, usually to accommodate foreign merchants at this stage – a legalism that would have been quite unnecessary a century or two earlier. In southern Italy and Sicily most major towns lay right on the coast, and acted as their own ports, creating an extreme openness that may have become ultimately socially destabilizing. But in the central part of the peninsula, city-states had evolved from different origins and all the towns, save Populonia (where metal-working installations lined the shore beyond the walls and slag filled the bay), were well set back from the sea.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 552](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=518&annotation=NWHSA3Z9))
