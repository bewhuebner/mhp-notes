“Because the high ends and upright finials of Khufu l resemble those of papyrus boats, it is called a papyriform vessel, a ceremonial type that reflects the origins of Egyptian hull construction. Representations of papyriform hulls are usually ritualistic in nature. Papyriform boats are used for pilgrimages to sacred sites, for symbolically charged hippopotamus hunts, and b the gods, particularly the sun god Re for his-travels across the sky in the m 'nd_t (day) and msktt (night) boats. When Khufu I and the neighboring sealed boat pit were discovered, scholars began a debate about its purpose that continues more than forty years later.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=66&annotation=H2ACVC2T))

“An alternate point of view is offered by Cerny, who suggests that Khufu I was not a solar barque, but a funerary boat for carrying the body of the king to Giza while the four other boats were intended to ceremonially transport him to the four cardinal directions.' Thomas agreed with Cerny that the Khufu I was not solar in nature because of its ten propulsion oars and the rectangular, rather than boat-shaped, pit in which it was buried.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=66&annotation=WEBC3SC2))

“Amon other arguments, Abubakr and Moustafa appropriately point out that the lightly later Pyramid Texts do not mandate a solar boat for the king, that the Khufu ship has a different form than most solar boats, and that none of the symbolic elements of solar boats were found with the Khufu I hull. The Khufu ship, in their opinion, exhibits none of the attributes of solar watercraft as enumerated by Selim Hassan. Hawass rebuts this last argument by pointing out that reed mats and flint tools can be considered solar symbols, and the matting and single flint knife from the Khufu I pit disproves the idea that the Khufu hull lacks a connection with solar boats. Whether or not the flint knife and matting are solar symbols, none of the other typical features of solar boats such as thrones, feathers, hawks and vaulted cabins were present. ==In view of this, it is unlikely that Khufu I can be identified as a solar boat.==” ([Ward, 2000, p. 59](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=67&annotation=ENI7Y5U7))
