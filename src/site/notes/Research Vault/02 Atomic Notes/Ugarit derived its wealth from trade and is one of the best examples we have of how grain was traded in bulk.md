“Like previous centres near this junction of north-south, east-west and land-sea routes, Ugarit’s wealth was pre-eminently derived from trade. Residues of metalworking are widespread, as are imports, plus local copies, from other parts of the Levant, Cyprus, Egypt, Anatolia and the Aegean. The archives reel off a plethora of predictable substances, but also some that typically suffer from low visibility. One was salt, and another grain, the latter of exceptional interest because although short and medium-range bulk movements of cereals surely became a regular feature in the topsy-turvy east Mediterranean environment as soon as sailing ships and carts became available, and certainly proved crucial to later Mediterranean urbanism, they tended to slip beneath the radar of texts and are archaeologically undetectable. Before Ugarit our sole glimpse is a consignment from Yamhad heading out of the basin to Mari. Ugarit recorded shipments up and down the Levant, most of them from, but also to, the cereal cornucopia of Egypt, though even these are hard to evaluate in terms of significance and frequency. Regardless, at a more general level maritime trade was clearly vibrant and crucial. Ugarit lay roughly a kilometre (half a mile) inland, but boasted five harbours. Closest to town, the exceptionally well-sheltered sandy cove of Minet el-Beida (then known as Mahadu) has produced a profusion of imports, including an ivory lid with a bare-breasted woman in hybrid style, found in a tomb with a built-in anchor, a freeze-framed snapshot of export in the form of a batch of eighty Canaanite jars lined up for loading, and debris from purple dye production. Another harbour at Ras Ibn Hani (then Biruti) furnishes our sole example of a mould for casting oxhide ingots, located in a palace at one stage occupied by Ugarit’s queen mother.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 393](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=369&annotation=UIBNQI78))
