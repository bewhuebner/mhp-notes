“Similar, but more tightly defined, is a Mediterranean delineated by plants. Various species have been recruited to this end; the most iconic is the olive, a frost-sensitive tree that needs the summer drought to produce its oil-rich fruit, and which for some possesses a mystical potency. Witness Durrell in purple torrent: ‘The whole Mediterranean – the sculptures, the palms, the gold beads, the bearded heroes, the wine, the ideas, the ships, the moonlight, the winged gorgons, the bronze men, the philosophers – all of it seems to rise in the sour, pungent taste of these black olives between the teeth’; or more gnomically, Aldous Huxley vaunting this tree as ‘symbol of a classicism enclosed in a romanticism.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 56-57](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=55&annotation=IUH7VLXQ))
