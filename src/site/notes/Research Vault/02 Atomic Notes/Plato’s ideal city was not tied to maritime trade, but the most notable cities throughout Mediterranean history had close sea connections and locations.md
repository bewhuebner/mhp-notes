“Plato placed his ideal city a wary 15 km (10 miles) inland, but in fact most of those we have encountered had their focal point advantageously nearer the shore, if seldom right on it until the comparatively late growth of towns out of intrusive enclaves in the centre and west. Typically such polities combined a maritime outlet with surrounding lowland fields and a rugged hinterland for forest-derived products, orchards, pastoralism or mining, a cross section through Mediterranean ecological variation; and while a few of the locations that we have seen flourish over the 2nd and early 1st millennia BCE were tiny islands with minimal adjacent farmland (Tyre being the ultimate example), most combined an advantageous maritime location with the arable wealth and ample labour that a decent, if rarely enormous, nearby territory provided.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 603](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=561&annotation=IXD4MEQA))

“One subversive message of this book has been the need for an alternative narrative of Nilotic history, viewed from the Delta, with the Ways of Horus curving off to the east across northern Sinai, and the Mediterranean shimmering just beyond.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 604](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=562&annotation=SCINGHWN))
