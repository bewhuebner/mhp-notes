It was designed to see what you could do to data to make it rise and fall at faster and faster rates in ways that resembled the decline in collective attention they had been documenting. What they discovered is there is one mechanism that can make this happen every time. You just have to flood the system with more information. The more information you pump in, the less time people can focus on any individual piece of it. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093G9TS91&location=502))

In 1986, if you added up all the information being blasted at the average human being—TV, radio, reading—it amounted to 40 newspapers’ worth of information every day. By 2007, they found it had risen to the equivalent of 174 newspapers per day. ([Location 512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093G9TS91&location=512))

What the scientists discovered is that, in fact, when people think they’re doing several things at once, they’re actually—as Earl explained—“juggling. They’re switching back and forth ([[task-switching\|task-switching]]). They don’t notice the switching because their brain sort of papers it over, to give a seamless experience of consciousness, but what they’re actually doing is switching and reconfiguring their brain moment to moment, task to task—[and] that comes with a cost.” This is called the “switch cost effect.” ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093G9TS91&location=611))
