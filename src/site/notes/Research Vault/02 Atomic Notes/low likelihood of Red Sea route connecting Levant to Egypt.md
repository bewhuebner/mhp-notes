“Instead, the rock drawing nearest the Red Sea is more than 50  miles inland, and all are in valleys that open into the Nile Valley. 24 Therefore, no evidence associates these drawings directly with the Red Sea.” ([Mark, 1998, p. 83](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=92&annotation=GHQEEZD2))

“The primary point of this review is  that my evaluation of the Gebel el Arak knife, the Hierakonpolis mural, and the rock drawings suggests that no evidence exists to support the belief that Sumerians  traded with Egyptians via the Red Sea. The Nile appears to be a more likely part of the route connecting Upper Egypt to Mesopotamia. This conclusion will be  supported by an examination of the Narmer palette.” ([Mark, 1998, p. 87](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=96&annotation=KED8VV6T))
