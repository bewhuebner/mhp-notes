“A swathe of Ubaid villages appeared (named after a type-site in southern Iraq), first in the south and then spreading back north, not without signs of conflict, to establish an unprecedented level of cultural and symbolic homogeneity throughout Mesopotamia. Large, dense villages of 9-10 ha (22-25 acres) like Ur and Eridu, with populations of a couple of thousand, became socially complex places that exercised a degree of administrative surveillance over flows of goods and materials through clay sealings and tokens, maybe controlling in this way smaller communities in their vicinity. They also erected small, free-standing temples. As on the northern side of the Mediterranean towards the end of the Neolithic, richly decorated pottery and other media gave way to plainer, more uniform material, but in this context not to ease communications between small-scale communities, so much as to standardize and order the material world - it is in this light, as well as a drive to boost output, that we should see the first use of a slow wheel to mechanize pottery production. The Ubaid’s potential was realized from around 4000 BCE in the emergence of the world’s first cities, at Uruk and Susa on the southern alluvium (the former covering 70-100 ha or 170-250 acres), and in the north at Tell Brak, possible ancient Nagar.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 238-39](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=225&annotation=JZY9KMF3))
