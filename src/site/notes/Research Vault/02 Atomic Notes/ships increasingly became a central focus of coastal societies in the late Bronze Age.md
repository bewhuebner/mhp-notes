“But by the 13th century BCE ships were already a preoccupation everywhere: in texts, in images ranging from official art to motifs on pottery, rock art and graffiti, and increasingly as debris on the seabed. A list of rowers from the last months of Pylos reveals a muster of twelve to twenty ships, as well as personal names that translate as Swiftship, Ship-famous and Fine-harbourer; a letter from Hattusa to Ugarit expressed curiosity about people ‘who live on boats’; and well before Merenptah and Ramesses in, an inscription from Tanis lamented that ‘the unruly Sharden (Shardana) whom no one had ever known how to combat, came boldly sailing in their warships from the midst of the sea, none being able to withstand them’. The last two examples betray a note of baffled imperial unfamiliarity and impotence in the face of people whose life was centred on the ungovernable realm of the sea. We shall return to this promising theme, but first, what of the ships themselves?” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 464](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=431&annotation=6AMAVW6U))
