“Egypt also engaged extensively with the Levant, as already attested by the transplantation of vines, and Uruk-type imports. Again, metals were critical, principally copper from Sinai and the southern Levant, and indirectly silver from more distant sources. But equally coveted were the woods, resins, aromatics, fruits and oils that flourished in Mediterranean environments, and above all cedar, in this case truly of Lebanon, whose hard, scented, decay-resistant red wood Egypt began to import a thousand years before Akkad, at first in tiny, but then ever-growing amounts. ==Flinders Petrie, excavating tombs at Abydos, found the sand so drenched in cedar oil that he could still detect its heady tang.== Along this axis, several modes of acquisition coexisted, all exploiting the constricted entry- and exit points of the Nile to enforce a cosmological quarantine between the ordered kingdom along the river and the allegedly chaotic world beyond. This also nicely facilitated royal oversight of the inflow of goods, and hence their use and dispersal within Egypt.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 285-86](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=263&annotation=MFM3C5LD))
