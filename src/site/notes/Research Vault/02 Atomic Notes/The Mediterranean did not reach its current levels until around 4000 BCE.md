“The end of the Younger Dryas reinitiated sea level rise, with a peak rate of 2.3-4.0 cm (0.9-1.6 in.) per year, or up to 4 m (13 ft) a century, at about 7500 BCE. The sea still stood 55 m (180 ft) below its present level in 9600 BCE; by 8000 BCE it lay at -35 m (-115 ft), at which stage most coastal outlines resembled today’s, and by 5500 BCE at only -10 m (-30 ft), after which the rate of rise petered out to reach approximately current levels a millennium and a half later.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 158](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=145&annotation=PDFU6CHN))
