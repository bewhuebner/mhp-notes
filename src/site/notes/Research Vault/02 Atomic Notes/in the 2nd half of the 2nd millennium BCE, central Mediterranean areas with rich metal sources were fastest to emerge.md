“The real winners lay as close to a source of metals as the sea could take one, as in the Cetina phase, but now further north and on a larger scale. In Chapter 8 we saw that metal production and circulation had been on the rise for some time in and beyond the Alps. Changing conditions in the east Mediterranean seem to have spurred on rather than interrupted this. Acqua Fredda, a smelting site in the southeast Alps, accumulated 800-1000 tonnes of slag. Pick-shaped ingots became a standard in terms of form and weight – indeed one hoard of such objects from Madriolo, in Friuli, weighs about a talent, the eastern measure approximated by one oxhide ingot, and there is a suggestion of a wholesale shift to east Mediterranean weight denominations in the northern Adriatic at this time. Turning to consumption, Austrian military engineers dredging Lake Garda in the 19th century initiated the discovery of Peschiera, a lake village or place of watery sacrifices that has so far yielded some 6000 items of metalwork, of types that travelled the length of Italy and on to Mycenae.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 477](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=444&annotation=JL46ST5P))
