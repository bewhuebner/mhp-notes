“Equally, mastery of the navigational technique of latitude sailing is implied by this time (if not earlier), by the growing confidence in cutting east-west straight across expanses of open sea to a target on the far side, at this juncture best attested by ultra-long-range links between Cyprus and Sardinia, via Crete and Sicily. In the absence of compasses, this involved observing the position of the pole star, and thereby confirms nocturnal travel and a summertime rhythm to such ventures in order to maximize the views of clear skies. The Mediterranean’s alignment and the sequence of major sea crossings within it was a huge advantage in this respect, and the ability to sail along a given latitude therefore the key to direct passage through the basin’s maritime heart (though the distance travelled along that line towards a safe anchorage or fatal shore long stayed in the realm of dead reckoning). Latitude sailing brought seafarers from Cyprus straight to southern Crete, and after minor resetting by coastwise travel, from northwest Crete to Malta (a link worth investigation), or from the western Peloponnese to Sicily (the latter recorded in Roman times as a two- to three-day run in good weather), and thence after more resetting to southern Sardinia – a passage later known as the ‘route of the isles’ and that closely matches the distribution of Cypriot material at this time. The opportunities for interaction denied by this strategic bypassing of intervening coasts were compensated for by the fast, direct conveyance of people, merchandise and news, the relative safety from the natural and human hazards of the littoral zone, and the sometimes convenient ability to disappear into the empty deserts of the sea. Indeed, for all the vast distances, danger of high-sea storms, and sheer durations of absence, such voyages must have seemed more attractive for merchants or envoys on specific long-range missions than a politically entangled, drawn-out and in its own ways equally perilous slog along the coast, a la Wenamun.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 465-66](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=433&annotation=6UWZC8X5))
