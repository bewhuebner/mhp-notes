“The expansion of sailing ship technology west across the Mediterranean was a stadial, staggered process that, as we shall see in Chapters 8 and 9, took the entire 2nd millennium BCE to reach Gibraltar - a reminder of the fact that such ships demanded a totally fresh approach to boatbuilding (simply mounting a canoe with a sail small enough to prevent capsizal made little difference to speed, while the Indo-Pacific outrigger solution was apparently never tried), as well as different operating disciplines, and capital investment that could as yet seldom be brought to bear. Instead, paddle-driven canoe technology was pushed to its technical and performative limits. How do we know this? Despite a number of seabed finds either lost overboard or from sunken cargos, true shipwrecks with hull remains still elude us, but we do for the first time possess clues of another kind, in the form of a sudden swathe of boat images that runs from the Levant and Egypt, as we have already seen, west to the Aegean and Malta.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 327](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=304&annotation=YAWR29H7))
