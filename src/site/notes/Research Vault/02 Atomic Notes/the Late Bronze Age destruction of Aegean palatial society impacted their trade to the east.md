“The final destructions of the palaces at Mycenae, Tiryns, Pylos, Aegean Thebes and elsewhere on either side of 1200 BCE represented a real political and economic rupture, entailing territorial dissolution, the extinction of a narrowly palatial literacy (a unique kind of loss at this time) and the dispersal of formerly attached craft specialists. Unlike the picture further east, there were abundant signs of trouble in the Aegean’s palatial societies over the 13th century BCE, in the form of unremedied destructions, accelerating investments in fortification, hints that prestige symbols were slipping from palatial control, growing penetration of Aegean trading activity by Cypriot interests and a dwindling presence of Aegean goods in eastern markets, to the point of virtual disappearance from Egypt.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 459-60](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=427&annotation=72U79L9G))

“However, as the Aegean entered its Iron Age in the 11th century, the reduction in scale and return to backwater status could not be disguised. Signs of external connections more or less dried up for two to three generations, a mere handful of communities (most plausibly Knossos, Athens and Argos) retained any claim to be more than small villages and regional populations slumped by between half and three-quarters, to levels last seen in the 3rd millennium BCE. A pollen core taken not far from the former palace of Pylos registers the lowest human impact on the landscape over the last 4000 years. Life among the clusters of thatched houses spread across the Aegean stayed as well attuned as ever to the basic rhythms of the Mediterranean environment, but it was on average briefer than before, and its parallels in terms of practices, values and horizons lay more with the centre and west than the world through which Wenamun wheedled his way further east.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 460](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=427&annotation=XMHBMJT8))
