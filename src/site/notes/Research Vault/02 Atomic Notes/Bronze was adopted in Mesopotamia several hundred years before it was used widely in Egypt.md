Bronze made its very first appearance in Mesopotamia in about 2800, and did not reach Egypt until about 2000. More significant for developing trade was its generalized use, which is harder to date with precision—say about 2000 to 1500, with Mesopotamia starting early and Egypt lagging behind. In the tomb of King Tutankhamun (c. 1350 B.C.) there are more copper objects than bronze.
