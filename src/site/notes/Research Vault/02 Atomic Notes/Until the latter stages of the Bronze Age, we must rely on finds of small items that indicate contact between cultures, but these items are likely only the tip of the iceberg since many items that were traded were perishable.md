“The typical archaeological signature of contact is a smattering of smallish items, such as scarabs, seals, jewelry and pots, to which we can add uptake of foreign symbols such as the Egyptianizing ones common in the Levant, or the monstrous griffins and versions of a minor Nilotic hippopotamoid deity, Tawaret, found in the Aegean. But while these offer thought-provoking clues, not least as to the regal or sub-regal flavour of such connections, it would be naive to assume that they indicate the full measure of contacts. We have in fact every reason to believe that much trade concerned materials that archaeologists seldom find in anything like their true original quantities. And in the exploration that follows, not every occurrence of such things necessarily denotes connections over great distances; much circulated internally or over short ranges, but collectively they define a maturing, and often long-lasting, basic repertoire for Mediterranean trade.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 376](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=352&annotation=GC6PEJP7))
