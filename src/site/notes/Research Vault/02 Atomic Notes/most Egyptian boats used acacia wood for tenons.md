“Dockyard records of the early Middle Kingdom refer to the delivery of boatloads of "white" acacia timber. Its hardness was valued for manufacturing tenons; the Khufu vessel, the Lisht timbers, and the shrine of Tutankhamen include acacia tenons. Coffins from the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms had both tenons and pegs of acacia; furniture of all eras, predynastic logs and roots, Early Dynastic beams, and tree trunks of acacia are also known.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=25&annotation=PBV7P65U))
