“Whatever the truth about occasional ultra-early Pleistocene efforts at seagoing, there is no sign that the sea had yet become anything but a divider, and for even the first 35,000-odd years during which modern humans lived around it, the picture stayed one of tentative, short-range crossings, restricted to a few encouraging areas. The decisive shift from such, in this respect, ‘pre-Mediterranean’ conditions to a purposeful, medium-range and proficient practice came just before the start of the Holocene, and appears again to have taken place in a few favourable places, notably the Aegean and the waters between Cyprus and its mainland neighbours. Later, some Mesolithic hunter-gatherers followed suit in the central sub-basins, but the breakthrough was only generalized by the expansion of farmers, which, together with their subsequent infilling of the smaller islands, ensured modest degrees of maritime linkage over most littoral and insular zones by 5000 BCE at the latest.

“The next phase began in the ‘long’ 3rd millennium BCE, with the rise of long-range voyaging, much of it driven by new ideological preoccupations and wider social networks on land as well as sea (none of which lessened the ubiquity of humdrum short-range activity, now or later; indeed, for quite different reasons, this was simultaneously on the rise, as we shall be shortly reminded). In most areas, voyaging was at first prosecuted in bigger versions of the canoes that must have plied the seas since at least the start of the Neolithic, but in the east it meshed with a separate initiative made possible thanks to capital investments on the part of the first emergent states: those marvellous, distance-eating, bulk-shifting machines known as sailing ships.

“Over the 2nd millennium BCE, sailing ships penetrated ever further west, being adopted as local maritime and social circumstances made it propitious, until, by around 1000 BCE, the preconditions for a regular, closely knit Mediterranean-wide network were in place, and this reality was swiftly realized over the next few centuries.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 596-97](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=555&annotation=2X3RGME2))
