"Set in the marshes of the lower Euphrates, Eridu was Sumeria’s most southern city and possibly its first. Tradition made it the earliest city to have a king before the days of the mythical Great Flood. Eridu’s archaeological story can be traced back to at least the sixth millennium B.C.E. If the tradition of its antiquity is true, Eridu may well have been the first city on earth.” (Bertman, 2003, p. 19) (pdf)
