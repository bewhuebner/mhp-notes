“Three other commemorative scarabs tell us a bit more about Amenhotep III’s personal life as a young man, since they were all produced in the first eleven years of his reign. One scarab describes how in Amenhotep III’s second year, as a teenager, he had an adventure. A messenger came to tell him that “there are wild bulls upon the desert of the region of Shetep.” Amenhotep arranged for a boat to take him downstream to Shetep, traveling through the night, so that he arrived there “in peace . . . at the time of morning.”” ([Podany, 2012, p. 196](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=221&annotation=M8N32DTP))
