“Discovered in 1994 and dated to 5450 BCE, the La Marmotta boat was a [[dugout canoe\|dugout canoe]] 10 m (33 ft) long and with a beam of just over 1 m (3 ft), all carved from a single oak. It would have taken hundreds of person-hours of labour to construct, and along with the Neolithic house must have been one of the most ambitious creations of its age. Travel around the Mediterranean in a near-identical replica powered with short paddles by a crew of eleven shows the design to be seaworthy. It averaged 3-4 km (2-2.5 miles) per hour at sea, or 32 km (20 miles) per day, although this should be reduced to 20-25 km (12-15 miles) for a laden craft and distances measured as the crow flies. This kind of performance would bring Lipari in range from Sicily in a single day, and tie many Aegean islands together by one-day crossings, but it implies two or three days and intervening nights to reach a place like Malta. Such ventures could easily exploit short windows of navigational opportunity, rather than being dependent on prevailing weather patterns, though runs to and from Malta and other Sicilian channel islands pushed the envelope in this respect, and may often have made better headway heading south with summer winds behind them.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 214](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=200&annotation=GGR98L4D))

“It is all too easy to assume, simply because we possess it, that the La Marmotta boat represents a breakthrough in waterborne technology, and thereby explains the parallel spurt in island life. But its replica’s performance confirms rather than extends the ranges proposed in Chapter 5 for earlier times, on the basis of the ethnography of simple seacraft and other experiments. Boats hollowed out by fire-setting and (in the Neolithic) polished stone axes surely had considerably earlier invisible origins, and altogether there seems no doubt that the La Marmotta craft was built to a basic design known at least since the first farmers set out for Cyprus several millennia earlier. So if islands were no easier to reach from the standpoint of nautical technology, why did more people go to live on them?” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 215](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=201&annotation=DBJ88B9P))

“Theoretical considerations (Table 1.2) suggest that by Neolithic times, in addition to rafts of logs, floats or bundles, and hideboats, seagoing logboats (stabilized, paired, or extended) could have been built. Simple plank boats were also technologically possible, but it may be that these would have been for inland waters rather than seagoing. The earliest known Mediterranean planked vessel, in fact, is dated to the mid second millennium BC (4.8.3.1) .” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 105](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=105&annotation=XB2IXDG2))

“Logboats have been excavated from Italian inland sites (Calcagno, 1997: 33-5; Castiglione, 1967; Simone, 1990) dating from the third millennium BC and later: from Lake Bracciano may be from the sixth millennium BC. With this logboat were found four models which probably represent logboats, the earliest known boat models in the Mediterranean (Calcagno, 1997: 4 8 , fig.i ) . Elsewhere in the Mediterranean, logboat studies are in their infancy. Some of the Italian logboats have features which suggest that they may have been one of a pair (Medas, 1993), whilst one may formerly have been extended by the addition of strakes (Delpino, 1991). These excavated boats are generally too recent to throw direct light on the Neolithic, but they do suggest that, in the central Mediterranean Bronze Age, techniques were known which could have been used to build paired and/or extended logboats with sufficient transverse stability to be used at sea: the use of stabilizing timbers at the waterline is also a possibility. Whether such techniques were used during the Neolithic is debatable.” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 105](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=105&annotation=J3DDUTVG))
