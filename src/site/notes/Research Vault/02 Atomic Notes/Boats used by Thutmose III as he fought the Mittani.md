“We can’t be sure of the identity of this king of Mittani, but he wasn’t so feeble that Thutmose felt assured of victory. He spent years preparing for his campaign, even creating prefabricated boats that could be assembled when needed.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 147](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=172&annotation=27B7YX4F))

“The campaign against Mittani involved Egyptian troops not only traveling over land but by sea as well. It seems, remarkably, that Thutmose III was able to surprise the king of Mittani and to force him to flee downstream and to the east. He couldn’t, though, force the Mittanian king to do battle with him. Unfortunately we have only Thutmose’s account, which presents the war as a huge victory for the Egyptians (the king of Mittani, who seems to have survived, no doubt told the story very differently). Thutmose III wrote that “there was no one to protect them in that land of Naharin because its lords had fled out of fear. I hacked up his cities and villages and set fire to them, my majesty having reduced them to mounds.” Not content with this victory and destruction of the cities, in one of his inscriptions Thutmose asserted that the towns “will not be repopulated, my majesty having carried off all their people as prisoners of war and their cattle without limit and their property as well.” He even “cut down all their orchards and all their fruit trees.” This is obviously hyperbole; had he taken the entire population of Mittani as prisoners of war he would have had nowhere to put them all.“ ([Podany, 2012, p. 147](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=172&annotation=27B7YX4F))
