“Beyond its immediate productive hinterland, early Carthage faced resolutely seaward, largely ignoring the land mass at its back, with its presence in North Africa accidental to the maritime logic of its location. Save for a handful of extraneous items and practices, Althiburos, away in the hills, remained a separate world.  

From the later 7th and 6th centuries, this began to change. Carthage, by now a massive trading city not readily supplied by cultivators walking out from it each day, and long a food importer itself, began to engage with local hinterland communities in the 6th century BCE, though not until a century later did its towers bristle on Cape Bon, the great promontory to its east that it turned into an agricultural paradise, and the climax of Carthaginian rural settlement lay later still.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 569](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=535&annotation=SDPTQP2T))
