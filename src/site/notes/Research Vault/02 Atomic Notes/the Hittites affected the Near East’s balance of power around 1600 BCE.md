“Then, suddenly, in 1595 BCE, an enemy appeared outside the walls of Babylon, an enemy so unexpected that it seems to have barely registered in the minds of the Babylonian kings up to that time. The enemy forces were commanded by a king named Mursili. (One form of his name was Mursilis, which sounds like the word “merciless,” a coincidence that fi ts the personality of this king well.) The Babylonian kings had fought Kassites, Elamites, and many others, but this new enemy was apparently unknown to them: Hittites, from the far- away Anatolian land of Hatti, about 700 miles northwest of Babylon, beyond the Taurus Mountains.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 121](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=146&annotation=7Q3QU9SC))

“The century that followed the attack on Babylon, from 1595 to 1500 BCE, is obscure right across the Near East because very little that was written (if much of anything was written at all) has been found” ([Podany, 2012, p. 125](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=150&annotation=I56HXZTE))

“When the smoke cleared around 1500 BCE, there was a new dynasty ruling Mesopotamia, a dynasty of Kassites.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 125](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=150&annotation=ARJU3HWH))
