“That now changes decisively, as an emblematic pair of discoveries at Huelva bear out. The first was made in 1923, when a river dredger struck a haul of over 400 bronzes, including nearly 200 swords, daggers and spearheads made at various points along the Atlantic facade between Ireland and western France, a few old east and central Mediterranean brooches, fragments of a 9th-century helmet from Mesopotamia and further pieces of unidentified scrap. Radiocarbon dates from accompanying wood suggest that this mass of metal went to its watery grave some time between 950 and 850 BCE. We can only speculate whether an accident befell a laden ship in the roadstead or, as so often along the northern flank of the Mediterranean (although less so in this sector of it), the objects were ritually sacrificed at a flashpoint of encounter and trade. Either way, this trove affirms the re-emergence of the Gulf of Cadiz as a trade hub, not least of Atlantic connections in abeyance since the end of the Copper Age.

The second, and for our purposes even more startling, discovery was made a few years ago during rescue work under the town of Huelva itself, 2.5 m (8 ft) below the water table and hidden by a layer of sterile mud. Up from this depth, unfortunately in no stratified sequence, came a mass of pottery and other finds dating to the 9th, and in a few cases perhaps 10th, century BCE. Over half the pots were handmade Iberian products, with a few imports from Sardinia and Italy, but some 40 per cent were wheel-made plates, bowls, jugs and amphorae of completely different pedigree, with precise matches on the Phoenician coast of the central Levant. Many of the latter seem to have been locally manufactured. Add to this several Cypriot and Aegean imported pots, abundant traces of silver, copper, iron and lead production, further residues from the working of ivory, ostrich eggshell, horn, wood and stone, Levantine balance weights and scraps of graffiti, as well as grape seeds, murex shells, amphora-bottled preserved fish and possible ship timbers, and the hallmarks of an east Mediterranean inrush and fusion with the far west become unmistakable.” (Broodbank, 2013, p. 483-84) (pdf)
