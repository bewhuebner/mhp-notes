“Then, around 600 BCE, a permanent enclave of traders began to coalesce on a promontory thrusting into a superb sheltered bay on the rocky flank of the Rhone delta, a day or two’s walk, or half a day’s sail, east of Saint-Blaise – closer than Gadir was to Huelva. The archaeology of early Massalia (Marseilles) is a victim of this well-sited city’s success ever since, but the community clearly began on a modest scale and, despite the story of its exclusive foundation by Phocaeans from the east Aegean, there are hints of Etruscan activity, as well as feasting and drinking areas of indigenous character - indeed ‘Phocaeans’ perhaps covered a multiplicity of characters circulating in the west.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 564](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=530&annotation=AMTKIYPV))

“In addition to Massalia, smaller trading communities emerged at the lagoonal mouths of other rivers that offered communications with the interior, creating further instances of the classic transect from coast to hinterland, with capillary effects on land and sea. Pech Maho, whose tablet introduced us to radical change in southern France, goes back to the early 6th century, and by this time Saint-Blaise was a fortified plateau with a heterogeneous culture. Late Etruscan-led efforts seem to have lain behind the appearance in the 520s BCE of Lattara (Lattes, near Montpellier in Languedoc), while Massalia promoted Agathe (Agde) and outposts further west, in the shadow of the Pyrenees, at Roda and the aptly named Emporion, initially on a river-mouth island (a rather ‘Phoenician’ choice of location). Both the last were tiny dots on the edge of a landscape of powerful Iberian communities, upon which Phoenician initiatives were also encroaching from the southwest.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 566](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=532&annotation=96LMDYKZ))
