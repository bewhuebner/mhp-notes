“By the later third millennium BC wooden boats were in use on the rivers and canals of Mesopotamia. These craft were generally paddled, poled, or towed, but some had a sail which Casson (1971: 23) believes may have been of wool or of reed matting. Some of the craft were for passengers, others for cargo. The cargo capacity is given in gur or kur which Casson (1971: 26) quoting Salonen, states was a volume measure equivalent to c.m litres, i.e. 0.121 m3 Oppenheim (1954:8) notes craft of up to 300 gur but the more usual craft appear to have been 60 to 120 gur in capacity (Casson, 1971 : 2 6 ; Bass, 1972:18). Some of these craft were used for fishing (Oppenheim, 1954: 8), but we may get some idea of the capacity tonnage that could be carried by the cargo carriers if we assume that their cargo was entirely of barley ( w h e a t would be 10 to 13 per cent heavier). Barley in bulk has a stowage factor of 1.36 to 1.50 m3/tonne; if in containers, this factor is 1.45 to 1.67 m3/tonne (McGrail, 1989??: 356).Assuming Salonen's conversion factor is correct, the 'standard' size of vessel of sixty gur would carry between 4.3 a n d 5.3 tonnes of barley grain, whilst the exceptional craft of 300 gur could carry 21.7-26.7 tonnes. These tonnages would have been subject to the vessels having a safe freeboard when loaded, but as it seems likely that these were river craft, freeboard is unlikely to have been a major constraint.” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 59](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=59&annotation=S24E8NAP))
