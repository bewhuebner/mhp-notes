“Putting together the landlubbers’ testimonies, shipwrecks, pictures, pots and navigational inferences, it transpires that ‘sea people’ had indeed come into being, if de-capitalized for lesser portent, shorn of their cohering definite article, and with the ethnic specificities laid aside: people ‘who live on boats’ in Hattusa’s words, ‘nomads of the sea’ or ‘[[the Sea Peoples\|the Sea Peoples]]’ in a felicitous modern phrase. To characterize such people as ‘pirates’ is rather like translating their terrestrial equivalents, the Levantine *hapiru*, as brigands; it captures the diversity of freebooting and sometimes predatory maritime lifestyles but imposes a judgment derived from the perspective of those in power who presumed to declare what constituted legality – and nobody, we can recall, had succeeded as yet in ruling the waves. If the term has value, it is in highlighting the oppositional stance to land-based authority, which distinguishes it from the otherwise similar small-boat trading and raiding that flourished all over the largely pre-state Mediterranean of the 3rd millennium BCE. Whatever we call them, the rise of such people is a compliment to the scale of contemporary maritime interaction, within which they played an integral role. Indeed, on a global scale ‘piracy’ has tended to shadow booms in sea traffic, and Braudel observed for the later Mediterranean that peak periods for low-tonnage ships (his ‘proletarians of the sea’) coincided with phases of expanding trade and liberation from monopolistic, institutionally sponsored, big-ship-dominated control. 

Moreover, it is likely that by the late 2nd millennium BCE some of the smaller ships and crews circulating in the Mediterranean had only loose, if any, affiliation to a home port or region – one reason why Egypt found them so mercurial. If so, and despite the certainty of low-visibility, localized earlier origins, it is to this phase rather than the age of Amarna and Uluburun (with its directed, spatially segmented long-range traffic between at least broadly defined destinations) that we should date the coming of age of Braudel’s caboteurs, tramps and ‘travelling bazaars’, always on the move, their cargo in constant turnover, and often literally melting pots of things bought, sold or otherwise liberated at coastal communities or from other ships along the way. The great merchants of Ugarit seldom had cause to sail as far as the Aegean, but humbler ventures by less tethered crews of mongrel traders, fighters and metalworkers were busy tying ever more of the Mediterranean together by following coasts, short-cutting across open seas, and hauling their craft over isthmuses. If we must seek a point of origin for this essentially rootless, and often route-less activity, in which ships themselves started to become crucibles of new identities, it would be the ever-flourishing non-palatial port-towns of Cyprus, where even gods looked from the waist up like fighting sea people, while they rested their feet on the ultimate emblem of circulating metal.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 466](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=433&annotation=8XA3H7EN))
