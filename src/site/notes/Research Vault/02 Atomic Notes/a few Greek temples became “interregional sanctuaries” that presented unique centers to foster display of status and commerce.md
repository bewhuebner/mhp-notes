“Most temples served similar roles to the smaller shrines that preceded them, but special opportunities arose at the great interregional sanctuaries of Delphi and Olympia. These were crammed with dedications by rich individuals and city-states that used their arenas to exhibit and compare their status before a cosmopolitan Mediterranean audience – we noted lucky Siphnos’s exquisite ‘treasury’ earlier. For elites, these places simultaneously offered a perfect venue in which to establish civic credentials at home while letting off competitive steam among their wider peer group, by making offerings and other honourable acts in the city-state’s name, especially once sporting events demanding leisure and wealth (notably chariot-racing) became part of the sacred festivals. Nor, despite strictures on participation in the games, were all the dedicants at such places Greek. At Delphi, an Egyptian king part-sponsored the rebuild of Apollo’s temple, a king of Lydia offered spectacular precious metal gifts, and in addition to the abundant Etruscan dedications, Caere erected its own treasury.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 558](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=524&annotation=2Q6JJP98))
