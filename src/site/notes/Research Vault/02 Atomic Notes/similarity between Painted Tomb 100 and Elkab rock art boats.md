“Another petroglyph panel with boats at Elkab that will be relevant to my argumentation is situated at rock art site 48, on a small rocky promontory along the northern edge of the Wadi Hilâl (Hendrickx & Huyge 1989: 16, n 48). The panel in question already drew the attention of the discoverer of the Painted Tomb himself, F.W. Green, in the early 20th century, who published a photograph of it and commented upon the general resemblance of one of the vessels with the Tomb 100 boats (Green 1903; see also Quibell & Green 1902: 21; for a more recent photo, see Huyge 2002: pl. 107). As many of the small details of the panel cannot be made visible on a photo, however, during the 2000 campaign of the Belgian archaeological mission to Elkab, a direct tracing of the panel was made; it is published here for the irst time (Fig. 2).” ([Huyge, 2014, p. 95](zotero://select/library/items/EYPX3L9X)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CU4GA9NI?page=4&annotation=WLXCHNP2))

“In conclusion, like is the case for the rock art panel at Elkab site 56, the creation of the one at site 48 does not seem to be a single event. For one reason or another, the original Naqada IIC-D tableau was modiied and completed in a later phase, most probably during the subsequent Naqada III period.” ([Huyge, 2014, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/EYPX3L9X)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CU4GA9NI?page=6&annotation=HIDXGXXV))
