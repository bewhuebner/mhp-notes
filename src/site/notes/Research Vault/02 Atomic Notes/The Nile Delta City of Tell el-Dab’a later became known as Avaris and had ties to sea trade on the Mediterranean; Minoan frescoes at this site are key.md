“Nor did all Tell el-Dab’a’s connections point to terrestrial routes. Pottery and jewelry with ties to Cyprus and Crete, as well as a locally carved cylinder seal portraying a sailing ship accompanied by Baal-Zephon, a north Levantine deity associated with the maritime world, confirm that the sea-paths were equally well-travelled. Some time between 1800 and 1650 BCE this vortex of people and networks acquired its better-known ancient name of Avaris, in which form we shall visit it again.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 362](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=338&annotation=ETGWPCHD))
