“[[Ur-Nanshe\|Ur-Nanshe]] (ca. 2550 B.C.E.) This ruler of Lagash engaged in building activities and is proudly depicted on a plaque carrying a basket of clay on his head to make bricks for a new temple. [[Ur-Nanshe\|Ur-Nanshe]] also promoted foreign trade between his own city and far-off Dilmun in the Persian Gulf.” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 109](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=122&annotation=B89IYAKX))
