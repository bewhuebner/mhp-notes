“Our second, very different, example of seaward orientation lies in the intensely coastal and insular landscapes of the Aegean. Even allowing for site losses to sea level rise, and uneven prospection (with a startling proportion of all known sites identified by a single scholar with a good eye), the last Aegean hunter-gatherers manifestly did concentrate in certain areas, mostly though not all coastal. Just outside the Aegean, we have just noted one such focus in northwest Greece; another has recently come to light around the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles. Others must lie undetected along further well-watered, estuarine stretches of coast, such as the west Anatolian seaboard. But it is Franchthi Cave that continues, as it did during the first obsidian procurement, to raise the standard in every sense, and to offer a superb window into how changeable the lifestyles of these hunter-gatherers could be.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 181](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=168&annotation=IIIVEMZT))
