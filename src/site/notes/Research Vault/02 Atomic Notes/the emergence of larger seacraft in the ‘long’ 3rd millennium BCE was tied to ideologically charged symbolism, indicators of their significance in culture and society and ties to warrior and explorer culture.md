“In addition to asking why bigger seacraft were thought worth building at this juncture, we need to consider why, after millennia of invisibility, boats suddenly spring into view. It was, of course, certainly not for our informational advantage. In fact, most of the contexts are ritually charged: decorated pots on which canoes are juxtaposed with vulvas, fish and stars or sunbursts, rock images accompanied by rich symbolism, and colossal sacred buildings in Malta and Egypt. They suggest that, unlike everyday activity in smaller canoes, which continued unabated, travel in the new craft was ideologically charged, imbued with power, status and cosmological overtones. Among the Cycladic islands, only the largest communities and most powerful men commanded enough people to crew such craft, which substituted for the mainlanders’ great houses as the foci of organization and investment. Outsized canoes were the means by which such places and people exerted control over sea communications, in practical and symbolic terms. Over short distances, such craft rendered sea-raiding far more devastating, and could perform awe-inspiring ceremonial roles. But their additional symbolic potency, and a source of glory for navigators and crews, lay in the realm of long-range sea travel, a spatial equivalent to terrestrial ascents into the high mountains.”

“Part of the reward and prowess resided in the exotic goods and news brought from far off to impress those at home, as well as engagement with illustrious people beyond the sea; that the voyagers were a tiny, exclusive minority is particularly clear in the Cyclades, where, out of a population in the thousands, only a few hundred probably crewed the big canoes, while most other people probably never travelled beyond their nearest neighbouring islands.”

“The ‘long’ 3rd millennium BCE begat the warrior ideal, as we have seen, but on certain coasts and islands this was matched and combined with an Argonautic and Odyssean one: the elite male seafarer as far-travelled, brave, enduring and wealthy through his deeds. Summer voyages timed to mesh with likely runs of favourable conditions will have clashed with the demands of the agricultural calendar at home, a mismatch that must have encouraged the greatest mariners to turn specialist, possibly at the level of entire communities at places like Tyre, Keros, Mochlos and the faintly suggested case of the Cadiz archipelago.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 329](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=306&annotation=5LGYDJLA))
