“Two possible routes have been proposed, a northern route through Syria-­Palestine that continued, either by land or by sea, to Egypt; and a southern route by sea through the Persian Gulf, around Saudi Arabia, up the Red Sea to the Wadi Hammamat, and, finally, by land to Naqada (fig. 1).” ([Mark, 1998, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=12&annotation=F72Q7772))

“To the south, Ubaid pottery, most of it from Ur, al Ubaid, and Eridu in southern Mesopotamia, has been found on as many as fifty sites around the Persian Gulf. It has been proposed that the absence of any evidence for permanent structures or trade at these sites suggests that this pottery marks places used only seasonally by early Mesopotamian fishermen.“ ([Mark, 1998, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=15&annotation=9HRS35U4))

“In the succeeding Jamdat Nasr period (ca. 3100-­2900 B.C.), Mesopotamian contacts and influence seem to have shifted away from northern Syria, focusing more strongly on the Iranian and Persian Gulf areas, as suggested by an increase in textual references to Dilmun and a corresponding increase in the archaeological evidence in Saudi Arabia dating to this period.” ([Mark, 1998, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=19&annotation=Z4QRD3R9))
