“More elusive, not least in Jerusalem itself, is the United Monarchy that the Old Testament claims that this house’s founder and his son, Solomon, established in the 10th century BCE. David’s youth as a *hapiru* in the hills, and the struggles against the Philistine polities, fit the picture around the turn of the millennium fairly well, but the Solomonic apogee has proven archaeologically harder to authenticate, fuelling suspicions that a more modest reality was subsequently gilded, during codification of the Old Testament’s narrative and divine message several centuries later. Opinion remains sharply divided, and aside from Biblical veracity, what rides on the debate for us is whether one major south Levantine polity (arguably the greatest of its day, albeit at a very low Mediterranean ebb in these terms) arose decisively before the wider 9th-century horizon, stimulated by Tyre and maritime trade on the Red and Mediterranean seas.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 499](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=466&annotation=97RHM9FD))
