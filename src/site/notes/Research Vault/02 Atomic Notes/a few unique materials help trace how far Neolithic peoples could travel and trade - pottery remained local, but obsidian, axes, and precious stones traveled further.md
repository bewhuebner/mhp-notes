“The vast majority of materials and objects used in most places were locally sourced, even if local quality was poor. We have already seen that, in contrast to its later performance, Neolithic pottery seldom moved very far – though a few trans-Adriatic instances stand out. Certain prized things were regularly displaced over 50-100 km (30-60 miles), notably hard volcanic grinding stones, ochre for pigments, cinnabar or the green variscite used in Iberia for ornaments, as well as fine flints, such as those of the Vaucluse, Alpine foothills, Gargano, and Hyblaean massif of southeast Sicily (the last producing blades up to 20 cm or 8 in. long). Beyond this, a few materials show up radically further from home. One is obsidian, to which we return below. But equally far-travelled were lustrous polished axes and amulets of greenish-blue metamorphic or igneous rocks, in particular those of southern Italy, the Aegean and above all ‘jadeite’, actually eclogite, from the western Alps. Bracelets made of the spiny oyster Spondylus gaederopus percolated deep into the Balkans and central Europe, mainly but not exclusively from the northern Aegean.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 229](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=215&annotation=MKR7ATZ7))
