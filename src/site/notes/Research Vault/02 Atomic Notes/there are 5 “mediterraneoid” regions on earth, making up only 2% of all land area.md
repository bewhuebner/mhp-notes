“It is, in fact, one of just five ‘mediterraneoid’ areas in the world. The others lie in southern California, central Chile, south and southwest Australia, and Cape Province in South Africa–a group for which the provenances of wine offer the best mnemonic, thanks to the friendliness of all to viticulture.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 61](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=59&annotation=AX8SDF8Q))
