“More generally, historians may well have set the transition from an early trading hub to the territorial, military empire that confronted Rome too far back in time. Between these two stages in Carthage’s life, during the 6th and early 5th centuries BCE, there plausibly existed instead a supreme network node, a huge city-state powerful at sea, where it deployed slave-propelled galleys to extract tribute from distant ports (themselves intensifying extraction from their hinterlands), but whose later explicit terrestrial militarism, much of it dependent on mercenary armies, was in part a subsequent response to aggression by others, and in the first instance heavily armed, probing Greeks. The 5th-century BCE fortification of Cape Bon was surely in part a defensive reaction to prior challenges, decisively repulsed, such as the Spartan effort to force an enclave near Lepcis, or a Sicilian Greek attempt to do the same at Lilybaion, at the southern end of Motya’s lagoon and right opposite Carthage itself.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 581](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=547&annotation=GMLCSFE5))

“Carthage had little trouble dominating by sea. In the central Mediterranean it had long been the major attractor for other Phoenician interests. In the west, where a few successful locations were already reordering connections to their own advantage during the 7th century, its increasing prominence correlated with further realignments as much as any formal imposed authority. Ongoing shifts there were inevitable given the emergence of a new zone of production and consumption further north in Catalonia and France, as well as a sharp decline in silver production in southwest Iberia, whether due to exhaustion of the lodes that could be accessed by existing technology, depletion of the woodland required for charcoal, or the crisis in local power attested (as cause or consequence) by the disappearance of elites from the lower Guadalquivir and the rise of less cooperative indigenous societies inland. The fast-growing populations and uptake of Carthaginian burial customs and ideology at the select roster of major maritime towns of Phoenician origin that still prospered, notably Motya, Gadir, Malaka and Ebesus, reflected both their mercantile success and the influx of traders and maybe monitoring officials from Carthage.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 581-82](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=548&annotation=RVJA443V))
