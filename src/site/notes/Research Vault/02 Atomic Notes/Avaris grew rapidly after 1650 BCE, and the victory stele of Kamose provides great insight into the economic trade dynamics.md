“Avaris after 1650 BCE was aptly christened ‘Venice on the Nile’ for its location on a series of turtle-backs among the braided strands of the river, and a 450 x 400-m (1475 x 1300-ft) central harbour basin linked to the main channel by canals, the analogy extends to the river-port’s role as a gigantic vortex of Mediterranean trade.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 36084](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=360&annotation=L43GW85E))

“The victory stele of Kamose, Ahmose’s predecessor who commanded the first Theban assault, describes how the women of Avaris peeped out from the fortifications like fledgling creatures from within their holes, and went on to announce with relish ‘I have not left a plank of the hundreds of ships of fresh cedar which were filled with gold, lapis, silver, turquoise, bronze axes without number, over and above the moringa oil, incense, fat, honey, willow, boxwood, sticks and all their fine woods – all the products of Retinu – I have confiscated all of it.’ Lest this be dismissed as hyperbole, extrapolated data from Avaris suggest that roughly 2 million Canaanite amphorae were imported over the 250 years preceding the city’s destruction, mostly from the central and southern Levant (the latter known as ‘Retinu’ in Egypt, and denoting a shift from the 12th Dynasty’s economic links to the centre and north). This implied the average arrival of as much as 600 litres (160 gallons) of oil, wine or other fine liquids every day. This economic stimulus electrified the east Mediterranean. Cypriot pottery exports to Avaris and the Levant surged, assuredly in part tracers of consignments of copper. It was now and shortly after the Hyksos age, too, that Cretan polities reached their high-water mark and, as we shall see, instigated closer ties with Egypt. Luxury goods were consumed mainly in the city itself or traded on at a high level; a subject settlement at Tell el-Maskhuta in Wadi Tumilat, another hybrid place with Delta roots, is practically devoid of them. This consuming influx applied to people as well, for Avaris’s population boom was not so much a prerequisite for its seizure of the lead position in trade, which had been in the making since the Middle Kingdom, but a consequence of its status as the east Mediterranean’s economic super-attractor.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 385](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=361&annotation=896687BK))
