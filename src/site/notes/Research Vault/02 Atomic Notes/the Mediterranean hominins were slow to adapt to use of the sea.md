“Overall, the conclusion in this chapter concerning early maritime activity and use of marine resources will be that the encounter between hominins and the sea was far from a case of love at first sight. For a very long time indeed, the Mediterranean Sea remained a forbidding expanse, a barrier circuitously circumvented, whose resources were only gradually learned and exploited, initially with both feet on dry ground. Plato, putting words into the mouth of Socrates in the Phaedo, famously likened the coast-dwelling inhabitants of Classical Greece to ants or frogs round a pond.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 87](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=84&annotation=LHRYQAAL))

“How did modern humans expand around the remainder of the Mediterranean? From a comparative perspective, the greatest surprise is that the sea initially acted as a barrier for them just as much as it had for their predecessors.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 108](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=108&annotation=4WTZKYKH))

#### Braudel

In fact the sea did not always in the past provide that “natural link” between countries and peoples so often described. A very long apprenticeship had to be served. Almost as daunted by the sea as later generations would be by the sky, primitive peoples did not risk taking to the waves in the Mediterranean until the twelfth and eleventh millennia B.C. at the very earliest, more likely the sixth and fifth (dates of which we are much more certain)—and even then it was a brave venture. But starting an apprenticeship does not mean attaining mastery all at once. Only with the third millennium B.C., if then, did fleets become of practical importance; in the second, effective trade became possible, and not until the first did ships sail out beyond the Pillars of Hercules on to the trackless waters of the Sea of Darkness.
