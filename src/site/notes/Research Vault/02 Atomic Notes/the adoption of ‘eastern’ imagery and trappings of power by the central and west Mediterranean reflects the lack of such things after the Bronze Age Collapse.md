“The insatiable desire of local leaders to acquire and customize objects and images of once eastern origin was a reflection less of any desire to emulate eastern political forms, than of the dearth of equivalent indigenous trappings of power in Iberia, Italy, and in the Aegean since the demise of the Bronze Age palaces, especially ones more subtle than simply displays of weaponry and other metalwork.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 520](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=486&annotation=JZPKVUYS))
