“Cypro-PPN farming was palpably of off-island origin and unveils the reach and potential of maritime movement by early farmers, with implications as crucial for early Mediterranean history as the prior achievements of seafaring hunter-gatherers. Slightly different crop profiles at each site, and parallels with diverse localities on the mainland on the part of the animals, argue against a single point of origin, but strong suspects for a primary role must be the archaeologically invisible people of the Gulf of Iskenderun before the appearance there of pot-using villages, whose hinterland embraced a zone of roundhouse architecture stretching to the Euphrates. This maritime nursery has already been highlighted in the context of Aetokremnos; one key to the Cypro-PPN is surely a continued tradition of seafaring there, while another must have been the loss of its coastal lands to rising seas, just as regional populations were also on the rise.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 177](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=164&annotation=GHM3QCKE))

“Viable numbers of people and five species of sizeable animals, plus a suite of crops, had to be shuttled over sea-gaps of at least 65-70 km (40-45 miles). Although we still lack physical remains or images, the most likely seacraft by this time are no longer permeable reed boats but watertight dugout canoes made out of great trees from the nearby mountains - as we shall see in coming chapters, there is no sign of any more powerful seagoing technology for almost another five millennia, and such craft would still be lucky to make the crossing in less than a couple of days. Moreover, this was not a one-off event. Three intriguing strands of evidence demonstrate that for a long time Cypriot farmers remained in close touch with mainlanders.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 177](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=164&annotation=5HUF4AI8))

“Seafaring, fishing, trading, tending of plants and animals and hunting were united in a cooperative endeavour essential for initial success and long-term survival. ==This nexus of confident social groups, microcosms of sustenance and robust seafaring technology operating over medium-range distances marked a distinctive Neolithic way of life that would bring radical changes to the ways in which people lived along the coasts, islands and hinterlands of the entire northern flank of the Mediterranean.”== ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 178](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=165&annotation=KT4R9GIT))
