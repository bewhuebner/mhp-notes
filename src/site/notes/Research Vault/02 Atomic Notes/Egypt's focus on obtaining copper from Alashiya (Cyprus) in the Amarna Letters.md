“Amenhotep III had only one real request when writing to most of the great kings: he wanted to marry their daughters. The greeting gifts that they sent were nice, of course, and Mittanian or Babylonian horses and chariots certainly could come in useful, but it was princesses that he was collecting. 

The same does not seem to have been true of his relationship with Alashiya, the island of Cyprus. Nowhere in the eight letters from the king of Alashiya to Egypt was there any mention of marriage or princesses. The letters were all business, because the Egyptian king wanted something very specific from Alashiya: copper. Egypt needed a lot of copper to make bronze tools, utensils, armor, weapons, and vessels—more copper, apparently, than could be mined within Egypt or the Sinai.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 252](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=277&annotation=CPFDYF83))
