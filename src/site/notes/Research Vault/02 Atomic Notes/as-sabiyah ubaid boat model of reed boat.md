“The model measures 14.5 cm long by 7 cm wide, with a maximum surviving height of just over 5 cm. The tips of the prow and stern were broken off in antiquity, and have not been found: comparable Ubaid-period models from Eridu and al-Ubaid indicate that sometimes they curled round (Lloyd & Safar 1981: Fig. 111; Hall & Woolley 1927: Pl. XLVIII). Certain structural features are evident: pairs of incised undulating lines are visible descending from both sides of the prow and stern; it is unclear whether these join at the centre of the vessel’s sides. These are reminiscent of the wavy lines painted on the sides of the Mashnaqa vessel (Theusen 2000: Fig. 5). If not decorative, they may indicate rope binding the reed bundles, the junction between reed bundles, or the join between different materials.” ([Carter, 2014, p. 95](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=6&annotation=NCPCG2UV))
