“Starting with the positive, it is remarkable how early a combination of the Mediterraneans ‘provocative’ geography (as described in Chapter 2) and the changing play of human interactions across it created central places that then drew further connections towards them, and how often these locations shifted as conditions moved on.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 598](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=556&annotation=AI9CFD2S))

“Moreover, what worked for specific locations could also apply to regions as a whole, and indeed this was one of the main ways in which entire new areas of the Mediterranean emerged into the limelight. Although the Levant’s overland routes are some of the oldest in the basin, its maritime prominence was largely a later function of macro-conditions only existent from the later 4th and 3rd millennia BCE, namely two superpowers at either end of it, plus sailing ships to run its length. Likewise, Etruria’s moment came when its arable and metallurgical wealth were coupled with a position between the growing Tyrrhenian, Adriatic and Alpine spheres, while Sicily, at the geographical centre of the basin, rose rapidly once Mediterranean-wide connections took off. The Adriatic exhibited an unusually sharply syncopated series of extensions and retreats from engagement with the wider Mediterranean, correlated with changing circumstances in the neighbouring Aegean and Tyrrhenian sub-basins (premonitions of the later relative fortunes of Adriatic Venice and Tyrrhenian Genoa?). In a sense, much of the history of an emergent Middle Sea is the history of evolving connections.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 598](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=556&annotation=H89ZWGRK))

“The accumulated, smoothed-out evidence of the last few chapters leaves no doubt that overall, in both relative and absolute terms, connections and mobility rose sharply in intensity and scale from the 3rd to 1st millennia BCE, after stabilizing or even locally declining following the initial spread of farming. The timing and gradient of this take-off makes the Mediterranean exceptional on a global scale. But even allowing for the fact that all Mediterranean people relied on some kind of local or medium-range interconnections to survive (and ever more so as the basin began to dry out), certain areas manifestly remained much less widely tied in than others, especially by sea. The most interesting example is North Africa west of the Nile.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 599](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=557&annotation=F8DMD4XC))

“Given that the connecting sea could bring danger, disruption and loss as well as gain, reclusivity could be no bad thing in its own terms; life for many people in southern France (a further area that had turned its back to the sea for long periods) was assuredly safer, if maybe less exciting, before about 650-600 BCE than afterwards. As expressed in Chapter 1, if the early history of the Mediterranean is in part that of how such seclusion was overcome, it is one often tinged with darkness.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 599](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=557&annotation=X7CGTWLL))
