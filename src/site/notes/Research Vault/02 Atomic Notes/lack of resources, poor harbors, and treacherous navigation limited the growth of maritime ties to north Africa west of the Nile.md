“In spatial as well as social terms the integration of Mediterranean Africa was still far from complete in 500 BCE. Long stretches remained untouched, notably most of the Maghreb between Carthage and Oran (due to a lack of desirable resources and poor harbours on a rugged and dangerous coast), as well as the arid Gulf of Sirte; the situation in the coastal corridor between Cyrenaica and the Nile is unknown.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 570](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=536&annotation=HUM7JQW3))

“The virtually total absence of evidence for North African seafaring west of the Nile has often been underlined in preceding chapters, and attributed to smooth coasts, scarcity of offshore islands and adverse navigational conditions, combined in the earlier Holocene with the magnetic pull of an inhabited Sahara. One minor exception is the filigreed coastline of Tunisia, where 6th-millennium BCE transport of Pantellerian obsidian into the eastern Maghreb could have been effected by African mariners. Activity in the Sicilian strait may have continued intermittently over the millennia that separated this blip from Carthage and any immediate predecessor, whose establishment along the same stretch of coast was assuredly no coincidence, and which had created the first North African ship imagery west of Egypt by the 6th century BCE. Aside from this, indigenous maritime interconnections in all likelihood simply did not exist along much of the southern, African shore. Even an earlier Egypt that was so active in the east Mediterranean and Red Sea had displayed no apparent interest in sending ships west along the coast. Instead, the integration of points on the African coast took the form (as during earlier, tentative manifestations) of north-south routes dovetailed to hubs of seafaring on the northern side of the Mediterranean. Hence the intimate ties between Carthage, Sicily, Sardinia and, later, the mid-strait Maltese islands, and Cyrenaica’s strong Aegean connection, which lasted until Crete and Cyrene were merged into a single Roman trans-marine province, governed from the south Cretan Mesara plain.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 572](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=538&annotation=FIXCVAF9))
