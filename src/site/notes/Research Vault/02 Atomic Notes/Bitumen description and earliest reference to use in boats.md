Bitumen is a mineral tar available in the Iraq/Iran region either as a liquid seepage (*naptha*) from an underground source, at the junction between plain and mountain folds, or as asphalt, limestone impregnated with bitumen (Hodges, 1964:165; Forbes, 1964; Ratnagar, 1981:3; Strabo, 16. i. 15). Bitumen is known to have been used to waterproof reeds for housebuilding by 4000 BCE (G. Clark and Piggott, 1976:180). ==The earliest reference to its use in boats is an inscription dated to c.2300 BCE in which [[Encyclopedia/01 People/Sargon of Akkad\|Sargon of Akkad]] claims to have been placed in a river as a baby in a basket of rushes (reed bundles linked by coiled basketry) sealed with bitumen (B. Anderson, 1978: 49): a comparable story is told about Moses (Exodus 2: 3).== Bitumen was used on working boats in the time of Hammurabi (1792-1750 BC) and subsequently ([[Herodotus\|Herodotus]], i. 179, 6. 119; Strabo, 16. 1.15; Pliny NH 16. 56,16.158; Forbes, 1964: 91-2; Hornell, 1946a: 57-8).” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 60](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=60&annotation=39FPADLK)) ([McGrail, 2002, p. 60](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=60&annotation=24MMVZ2Z))

“[[Encyclopedia/01 People/Sargon of Akkad\|Sargon of Akkad]] (Sharru-kin) (2334–2279 B.C.E.) Sargon was a Semitic ruler of Akkad who conquered Sumer and united the two lands under his leadership, thereby forming the most extensive kingdom Mesopotamia had ever seen. His capital was founded at Agade, “the only royal city of ancient Iraq whose location remains unknown” (Roux 1992: 152). His imperialistic ambitions carried him and his army to Iran in the east and Syria in the west. As he boasted in an inscription: “Let any king who regards himself as my equal go where I have gone!” ==A legend (that may have inspired the biblical story of Moses’ birth) related that his mother gave birth to him in secret, thereafter placing him in a reed basket and floating him down a river until he was found by someone (a drawer of water) who adopted and raised him. Shown divine favor (by the goddess Ishtar), he went on to fulfill his royal destiny.== Sargon’s name means “legitimate ruler,” implying that he may in fact have been a usurper, a theory supported by another account: that he had served as cup-bearer to king Ur-zababa of Kish until he seized the king's throne for himself.” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 100](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=113&annotation=RR4AQWIR))

“A unique resource of the land was bitumen, a natural asphalt that seeped from beds in the ground, especially in the area around Hit on the Euphrates. Bitumen had many uses: as an adhesive for bricks, as a waterproof coating in construction, and as a cement to create works of art.” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=17&annotation=REAIMQZN))

#### Strabo 16 1.15

Babylon produces also great quantities of asphalt, concerning which Eratosthenes states that the liquid kind, which is called naphtha, is found in Susis, but the dry kind, which can be solidified, in  p217 Babylonia; and that there is a fountain of this latter asphalt near the Euphrates River; and that when this river is at its flood at the time of the melting of the snows, the fountain of asphalt is also filled and overflows into the river; and that there large clods of asphalt are formed which are suitable for buildings constructed of baked bricks. Other writers say that the liquid kind also is found in Babylonia. Now writers state in particular the great usefulness of the dry kind in the construction of buildings, but they say also that boats are woven with reeds and, when plastered with asphalt, are impervious to water.
