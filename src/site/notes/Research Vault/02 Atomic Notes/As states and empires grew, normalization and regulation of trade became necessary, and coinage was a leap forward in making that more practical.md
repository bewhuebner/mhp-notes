“Coinage had a natural advantage over barter: unlike grain or livestock, coins were eminently portable and universally attractive as tokens of exchange, especially when the state, rather than individual merchants, guaranteed the weight and purity of the precious metal they contained. Indeed, the manufacture of a national coinage constitutes yet another step in the control of commerce by the state. At first, individual merchants put their own personal mark and guarantee on lumps of precious metal. But the larger the territory of a state became, the more it overlapped the wide commercial territory of merchants, and the more sense it made for the state to normalize and regulate transactions, especially if, by such regulation, commercial exchanges could be facilitated and accelerated to enhance the state’s own wealth and power. Prior to the introduction of coinage, the basic mediums of exchange in Mesopotamia were grain (measured by volume) and silver (measured by weight). Even the value of gold was expressed in terms of the more common metal, silver. In terms of relative value, first came gold (eight to 15 times more valuable than silver by weight); then silver; next lead; then copper; and finally iron, which became a common metal only in the first millennium B.C.E..” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 257](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=270&annotation=HY9C9XXL))
