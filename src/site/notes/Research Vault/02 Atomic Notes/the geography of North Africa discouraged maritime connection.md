“In short, the strong gravitational pull of the coast witnessed elsewhere in the basin was inverted in Mediterranean Africa. One negative reason, as noted in Chapter 1, may have been the unfriendliness of much of this long shore to maritime experiments, but such an aversion implies the existence of a positive alternative too. This was the enormous, patchily verdant, game-rich Sahara of the early Holocene, which for North Africans acted as a much more powerful super-attractor than the sea.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 199](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=186&annotation=3PKUGXVN))
