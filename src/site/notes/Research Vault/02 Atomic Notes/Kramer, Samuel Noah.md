“Samuel Noah Kramer 20th-century American philologist. The leading Sumerologist of the 20th century, Kramer classified and deciphered neglected cuneiform tablets in museums around the world. Through his translations and the cultural synthesis he constructed, Kramer gave the Sumerians their rightful place as the creators of what may have been the world’s first civilization.” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 44](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=57&annotation=GUCZWYPM))
