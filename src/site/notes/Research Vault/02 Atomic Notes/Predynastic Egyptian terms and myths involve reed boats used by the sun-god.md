“Among the many puzzling archaic terms which often baffle students of the Pyramid Texts, the oldest of Egyptian literature, are the "two shn![Pasted image 20230720220254.png|100](/img/user/zz%20Images%20Dump/Pasted%20image%2020230720220254.png)of the sky," on which the Sun-god and, like him, the deceased king are said to ferry across to the sky:![Pasted image 20230720220354.png|400](/img/user/zz%20Images%20Dump/Pasted%20image%2020230720220354.png)(Pyr. 337 a), "the two shn of the sky are laid for ReC, that he may ferry across to the horizon therewith." A comparison of the two elongated objects which appear here as the determinatives of the word with the modern Nubian native's floats shown in P1. XXXIII, Fig. 2, leaves little doubt in one's mind as to what the two shn were” ([Breasted, 1917, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/UNIHDJ7X)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DSCT6KYR?page=4&annotation=3LEFHUR2))

“A myth which makes the Sun-god cross the celestial waters on two reed floats must have grown up in the minds of primitive Nile-hunters, who equipped their gods with the simple devices of their own everyday life, just as the Old Kingdom priests invested him with the royal splendour to which they had grown accustomed when he became the State god. The two reed floats, therefore, are a part of the scanty survivals from the Sun-god's earliest history in the Nile valley. It is evident that the Sun-god, thus associated with devices peculiar to the Nile in an age lying far behind the beginnings of civilization, was a divinity belonging there from the beginning and not imported from Asia, as has been recently suggested though without any weighty evidence.” ([Breasted, 1917, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/UNIHDJ7X)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DSCT6KYR?page=5&annotation=9U7RE7QN))
