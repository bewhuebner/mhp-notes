### structural evidence at [[As-sabiyah\|As-sabiyah]] (h3)

“At least three, possibly four, separate structures have now been exposed; their extent and stratigraphic relationships remain to be determined by further excavation. Numerous other structures and walls are visible outside the excavated area, mostly concentrated in the higher parts of the mound. The structures themselves are built of undressed flat slabs of local stone (beach rock and red sandstone). Mortar and plaster were not used, and the walls survive to six courses in places, up to 0.47 m in height.” ([Carter, 2014, p. 92](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=3&annotation=JW2LC9NY))

“Pottery is comparatively frequent at H3. Macroscopic examination indicates that 80% consists of Mesopotamian Ubaid ware, both plain and painted.” ([Carter, 2014, p. 94](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=5&annotation=TGV59AUS))
