“The clash of plates, which continues today as Africa muscles 2 cm (0.8 in.) a year into Europe, accounts for the fundamentals of the Mediterranean’s outline.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 63](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=61&annotation=P8RA3YZU))

“Any sailor approaching the sheer walls of Mallorca’s Tramontana, the White Mountains of Crete or the sabre-line range hanging over Kyrenia on Cyprus soon realizes that most islands are the tips of other, sometimes towering, submarine massifs.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 64](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=62&annotation=Q2AS4RCZ))

“Needless to say, the tectonic clash also explains why the Mediterranean is so prone to earthquakes and punctuated by active, dormant and extinct volcanoes.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 64](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=62&annotation=RFFYNSNZ))

“Etna’s birth was one of many such cataclysms in the Tyrrhenian region, and comparable processes of uplift, subsidence, contortion and volcanism were at work more widely across the Mediterranean within the same expanse of time.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 88](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=85&annotation=L25RTF9N))
