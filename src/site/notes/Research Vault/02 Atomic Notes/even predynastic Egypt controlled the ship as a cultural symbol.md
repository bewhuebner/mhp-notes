“Williams traces the association of oared boats and pharaonic imagery back to Naqada I or the beginning of Naqada ll, and sees a royal monopoly on ceremonial attributes of ships in predynastic and Early Dynastic ship representations. The sacred bark belonged exclusively to the gods, the pharaohs, and the dead, never serving ordinary purposes. Control over the ship as a cultural symbol, both as a concrete object and as a representation, suggests that the state already allocated resources preferentially and had access to materials and labor not available to the general population.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=13&annotation=EHVS3C9N))
