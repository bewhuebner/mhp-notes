“Over the course of the 10th century BCE Sidon in turn ceded its primacy to the island of Tyre (originally *Tzur*, meaning ‘rock’ or ‘fortress’), a place occupied on and off since the 3rd millennium BCE, but until now of secondary rank. This shift may reflect the benefits of a natural sea-moat as terrestrial powers began from time to time (as we shall see) to stalk the Levant again.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 486](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=453&annotation=SNKSS3GH))
