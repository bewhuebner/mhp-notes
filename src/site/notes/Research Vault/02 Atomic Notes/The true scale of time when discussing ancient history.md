“One tends to think of the twenty-third century BCE—almost 4,300 years ago—as close to the beginning of civilization. To get a sense of just how long ago this was, look at it this way: more time passed between the lifetimes of Irkab-damu and Julius Caesar (around 2,200 years) than has passed from Caesar’s death to the present (less than 2,100 years).” ([Podany, 2012, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=45&annotation=D7SEIYNV))
