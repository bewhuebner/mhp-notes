“In other words, there was no pristine Phoenician ‘discovery’ of the west save in terms of prior eastern ignorance. The opening up of the western seaways and tidal reaches of the Atlantic was initiated by central and then west Mediterranean seafarers, albeit using adapted eastern nautical technology and at moderate degrees of intensity compared to Levantine activities at this time. The first eastern traders slotted into such networks and presumably benefited from local experience, possibly even local pilots. The scale of their activities there would in turn soon begin to transform the west, as we shall see in the following chapter, but despite the brilliance routinely attributed to Phoenician seafarers (the pole star itself would later be named Phoinike), and without diminishing the prowess of their trans-Mediterranean ventures, the fact is that here, as elsewhere, they were inheritors to a mass of orally transmitted, often mythologically encoded, knowledge about navigational conditions and hazards, memorized sequences of land- and seamarks, significant places, people and resources, and the intricacies of local custom, all accumulated by a multitude of anonymous Mediterranean seafarers.

==This raises the spectre that not everything we call ‘Phoenician’ in the centre and west had much to do with sailors from the east. If a fuzzy term even in the Levant and Cyprus, it could surely disguise a still more varied gallery of actors in and beyond the Tyrrhenian, united by maritime trading practices as much as origin (in this sense ‘Phoenicians’ were true descendants of ‘sea people’).” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 494](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=461&annotation=IDN2SHHP))==

“None of this is to deny the presence of long-haul traders from the Levant, and among them from an early stage organized, strategically minded Tyrian missions, but it does make us reflect that for every such ship other crews were also at sea, hailing from different harbours and intent on journeys of differing duration and destination. And this in turn urges us to revise how we conceptualize Mediterranean networks during the opening centuries of the new millennium. Too often these are reduced to a bold Tyrian arrow thrusting west, with occasional spurs to north and south. Yet even this arterial route was stitched together from segments that could be equally travelled as self-contained journeys and all around swirled myriad other connections, especially on the northern flank, where islanders and coastal people had been forging self-sustaining webs of interaction within each sub-basin, and connective ones between them, for millennia. Precisely who participated in which is ultimately less interesting, and certainly far less fathomable, than the convergent, reticulate maritime world that their integration created.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 494](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=461&annotation=DFBCT9HC))
