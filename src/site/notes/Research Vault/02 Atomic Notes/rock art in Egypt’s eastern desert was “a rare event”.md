“Overall the pattern suggested by the time-span and number of sites is of few people involved in a restricted period of time, approximately 3800-3650 BCE, within the predynastic period. Overall, with the exception of the ‘hand on hip’ hunters, the impression is of a number of people making petroglyphs at one or two sites, not of one group going down a route responsible for numerous sites. This is true even of narrow and quite straight wadis such as Umm Salam which are easy under foot to navigate. One site will consist of several ibex with a human figure, the next a few boats, followed by a major ‘Integrated’ site, and then again a small herd of animals. Considering the last 6000 years, there are approximately 500 separate surfaces on which petroglyphs have been made. Even assuming the addition of three petroglyph scenes of different dates at each surface means one creation every four years, and one every 2-3 years over only the predynastic and pharaonic periods. Rock-art creation in the survey area was thus a rare event.” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 311](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=343&annotation=JL6LQVTS))
