“The northern limit of Egypt, where marshy lagoons gave way to coastal dunes and then the sea, was known in antiquity as ‘Reed-thicket’, a name surely ever on the move, and indeed in the last 10,000 years the [[Nile\|Nile]] Delta has grown from a vestigial stub to a fertile triangle 17,000 sq. km (6500 sq. miles) in extent, rivalling the cultivatable land in the valley to its south by the time of the pharaohs, and larger than all but two Mediterranean islands.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 77-78](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=75&annotation=89RWQFFQ))
