By around 3500 the unmistakable iconography of kingship was given full expression in a tomb at Nekhen known as the Painted Tomb. One of the inside walls of this burial chamber was plastered and painted with a frieze showing a royal figure taking part in various ritual activities. The decoration is dominated by a spectacular procession of boats, but in one corner of the scene the king is shown smiting three bound captives.

“Nevertheless, on the basis of the objects found within the plundered tomb upon its discovery in 1899 (mainly pottery, two small stone vases, a fragmentary lint knife with V-shaped forked tip, and a few pieces of bone), it seems beyond discussion that it was used for human interment in mid-Naqada II times exclusively, more specifically in the Naqada IIC phase, which is currently dated to c. 3600-3450 BC” ([Huyge, 2014, p. 94](zotero://select/library/items/EYPX3L9X)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CU4GA9NI?page=3&annotation=4N3QX8SZ))
