About a thousand years later, under the Eighteenth Dynasty, a Theban painter depicted boats built by Canaanites (as the peoples of the Syrian coast were called, the ancestors of the Phoenicians) landing goods from their country on to a quayside. The boats were unquestionably of Egyptian design, similar to, if a little rounder than, the ones which Sahura sent to Byblos, with their familiar raised ends. The boats which Queen Hacheptsut (Eighteenth Dynasty) launched for her maritime expedition of 1480 B.C. to the Punt, and possibly to Somalia, were longer and lay lower in the water, but had similar rigging. The mast was in the centre of the hull and carried a large square sail: two long paddles acted as a rudder. The beautiful model of a fully rigged sailing ship in Tutankhamun’s tomb, a hundred years later, shows identical features in hull and mast to the Punt ships. Only the system for the rudder is different. ([Location 1768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004FEFSCC&location=1768)) (Braudel 2001, p. 79)
