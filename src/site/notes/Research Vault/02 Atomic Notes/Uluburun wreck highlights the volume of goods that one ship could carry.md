“This wreck highlights not only the variety of invisible trade goods aboard this one ship but also the large quantities of such goods. If we were to collect all the bronze  from all known Late Bronze Age land sites, we would probably have only a fraction of the amount of tin and copper recovered from this one shipwreck (ca. II tons),  and the copper and tin from this one shipwreck represent only a small fraction of what was produced, traded, and shipped in the Late Bronze Age. Therefore because  a few small ships could transport relatively large quantities of goods between Egypt and northern Syria every year from the Late Predynastic period through the beginning of the First Dynasty, great quantities of raw materials and unfinished goods could have been exchanged between such distant sites as Egypt and northern  Mesopotamia without leaving much trace in the archaeological record.” ([Mark, 1998, p. 125](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=134&annotation=ZMYXX7YQ))
