“For bulk transport, a plain, collared, pointed-base form that held up to 25-30 litres (7-8 gallons) (or a similar weight to that other commodity, the oxhide ingot) evolved out of earlier prototypes. Known as the Canaanite jar, it was in effect an amphora, and stands at the head of a lineage of vessels that would dominate trade in liquids in and beyond the Mediterranean until less than a thousand years ago. The pointed base aided lifting, embedding in beach sand and multilevel stacking shipboard. For small volumes of more precious liquids, a range of attractive little juglets was created in the Levant, Nile Delta and Cyprus. Each region had its own instantly recognizable shape and shiny, painted or incised surface. This enables us to trace exports, and soon their imitations, with gratifying accuracy. More importantly, and again with a few premonitions back in the 3rd millennium BCE, it manifests a phenomenon that is still with us: visual branding of luxury goods. Towards the middle of the millennium Cypriots made a successful push to take over this market with new ‘base-ring’ types. The Aegean, which displayed a decidedly sporadic record in this respect in the early centuries of the 2nd millennium BCE (implying a later start for its export trade in liquids?), and which vehemently rejected the canonical amphora form until the Bronze Age was over, began around the same time to circulate its own side-spouted shape, known due to its peculiar handle as a ‘stirrup jar’. This versatile form could act, dependent on size or decoration, in either bulk or bijou capacities, and would become one of the most widespread trade forms in the Bronze Age Mediterranean.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 379](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=355&annotation=9GSD84JD))
