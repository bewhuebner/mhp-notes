The Levant constitutes a derisory 3.3 per cent of the land in the basin, but thanks to its wider connections this scrap has repeatedly been of disproportionate significance on the Mediterranean, and indeed global, stage.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 59](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=57&annotation=M25Y6DED))
