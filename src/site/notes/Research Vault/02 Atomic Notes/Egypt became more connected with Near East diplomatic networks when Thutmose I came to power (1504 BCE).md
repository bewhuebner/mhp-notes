“In 1504 BCE, right around the same time the Dark Age was ending in Mesopotamia and almost seventy years after Agum-kakrime had brought the statues of the gods Marduk and Sarpanitum back to Babylon from Hatti, a king came to power in Egypt who was to launch his kingdom into the international world of the Near East. His name was Thutmose I, and his goals were neither diplomatic nor peaceable; he was interested in war. He led his newly formed army on a march right across the Levant and all the way to the Euphrates, to regions that, as far as we know, no Egyptian king had ever visited before. The Egyptian kings before him had focused their aggression on Nubia to the south, keeping their distance—whether consciously or inadvertently—from Syria and Mesopotamia. Now these ancient lands—Egypt on the one hand, and Syria and Mesopotamia on the other—would have to figure out what to make of one another. Initially, at least, they seem to have felt nothing but hostility. Eventually, though, Egypt became a vital member of the diplomatic world of the Near East.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 131](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=156&annotation=3BPDUHKU))
