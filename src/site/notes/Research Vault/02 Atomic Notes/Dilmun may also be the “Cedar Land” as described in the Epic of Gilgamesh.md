#USE in [[003 - Surplus Food, Big Buildings, and Power Hungry Lugals\|003 - Surplus Food, Big Buildings, and Power Hungry Lugals]] re: Dilmun and possible location

“If the identification of the "Cedar Land," the place where the sun rises, with Dilmun should turn out to be correct, then the land to which Gilgamesh and Enkidu make their dangerous and adventurous journey in the epic tale "Gilgamesh and the Land of the Living" might also turn out to be Dilmun, although it is never explicitly so called in the poem. For this land, too, is characterized as a land of cedars, and the deity in charge of it is none other than the sun-god, Utu. Moreover, its epithet "the Land of the Living" may point to its identification with Dilmun; for Dilmun, according to the poem "Enki and Ninhursag: A Sumerian Paradise Myth," is described as a land where The sick-eyed says not "I am sick-eyed," The sick-headed says not "I am sick-headed," Its (Dilmun's) old woman says not \*1 am an old woman," Its old man says not "I am an old man." lines which seem to say indirectly and obliquely that Dilmun is a land of deathlessness and immortality. This would explain, of course, why Ziusudra had been transplanted to Dilmun once the gods had granted him immortality. In fact, it may yet turn out that Gilgamesh traveled to "the Land of the Living" in quest of immortality, in spite of the fact that the initial passages in the poem "Gilgamesh and the Land of the Living" point to the drive for name and fame as the impelling motivation.” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 282](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=282&annotation=RAVKTRHG))
