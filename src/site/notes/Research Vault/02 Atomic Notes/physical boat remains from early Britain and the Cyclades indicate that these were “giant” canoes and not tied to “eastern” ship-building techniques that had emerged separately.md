“Physical remains of boats constructed by lashing the planks together survive from the 2nd millennium BCE in British estuaries, and such ‘sewn’ craft are also known from later wrecks and art in the west and central Mediterranean, where they may represent the epilogue to an older, more widespread tradition (indeed lashing may be indicated by zigzags on the hulls of a few Cycladic depictions). While the dearth of earlier images makes it impossible to prove categorically or deny that such outsized canoes plied Mediterranean waters prior to roughly 3500 BCE, the overall horizon of depictions, the introduction of facilitating (if not strictly essential) metal tools, including saws, and the simultaneous rise in maritime activity converge to argue for a genuine innovation. Where this began we cannot say. The date of the Andros boats, and the distinctive design, rule out any debt to Byblos ships and also prove an Aegean contribution, but other foci further west are likely too. Last but not least, a comparison with the great paddled canoes of New Zealand, California and the Pacific Northwest before and at the time of European contact offers further insights. Such craft were liable to have been used in warfare and ceremonial as well as trade, could carry a modest cargo of about a tonne, and covered at least 40-50 km (25-30 miles) per day, at double the speed of a smaller canoe - but less than half that of a sailing ship with a fair wind.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 328](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=305&annotation=7F54WIAS))
