“Barber’s (1991) research into prehistoric textiles has shown that many objects in the archaeological record have been misinterpreted, and are in fact tools used in textile production. The characteristics of the Eridu vessels can be better understood if they functioned as spinning bowls for plying thread, the stage of production during which two or more strands of thread are twisted together to provide additional tensile strength.” ([Strasser, 1996, p. 922](zotero://select/library/items/NBBF3WPV)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7GGSX85?page=3&annotation=SZ6P8L7U))
