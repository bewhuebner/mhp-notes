“From such calculations it seems likely that, during the early days of seafaring, most if not all, Mediterranean islands would have been visible from the mainland, “from another island nearer the mainland, or from a boat which had not yet lost visual contact with already known land. Thus there would have been no necessity to rely on the flight path of migrating land birds, unplanned drift voyages, or other means that had to be used over greater distances in Oceania, for indications of land beyond the horizon: all islands in the Mediterranean were within the ideal horizon when viewed from some part of the European, Asian, or African mainland, or from a boat still within visual range of the mainland.” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 99](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=99&annotation=IDQNSE3N))
