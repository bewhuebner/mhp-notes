“This was a big part of the gift exchange as well: the public display of the goods received. Kings wanted to be able to show off what they had received from their brother kings, almost as though it were tribute. With a good exchange, each king gained not only in wealth but also in prestige in the eyes of his vassals, allies, and subjects.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 78](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=103&annotation=XBJ3ZHXX))
