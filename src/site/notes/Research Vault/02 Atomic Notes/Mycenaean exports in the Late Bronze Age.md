“By the mid-fourteenth century, Mycenaean wine and perfumed oil were being exported in striped stirrup jars to cities all over the Levant, Cyprus, and Egypt. Mycenaean potters even made ceramics in distinctive shapes just for their trading partners. The Mycenaeans manufactured textiles in vast amounts, according to the Linear B tablets—600 women were employed as weavers by the palace at Pylos alone—and these fabrics might also have been exported abroad.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 260](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=285&annotation=33SQYMCZ))
