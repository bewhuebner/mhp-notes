“By the Last Glacial Maximum certain people commanded seagoing abilities sufficient to cross modest stretches of open water, and there are sporadic signals of earlier short-range activity going back to the Aurignacian, and perhaps Neanderthal or even older culturally enhanced forms of floating. Such intermittent, tentative false starts and messing about with prototypical boats manifestly had a long, if thoroughly obscure, history, and forms the background and baseline for subsequent Mediterranean developments. ==But a presence of people on [[Cyprus\|Cyprus]] denotes something that on present evidence is entirely new: substantially longer-range, actively navigated and probably more regular maritime movement.== The deep seas surrounding Cyprus ensured that the distances were little different from modern ones, namely 65-70 km (40-45 miles) from Turkey and 100 km (60 miles) from the northern Levant, both crossings entirely without intervening stepping stones, and therefore giant leaps by the Mediterranean standards of their time. Moreover, the fact that early sites encircle the island could imply further cruising along the shore after initial landfall, searching for suitable campsites.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 152](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=139&annotation=IRETU99U))
