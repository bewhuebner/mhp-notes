“Some of the last Neanderthals on the planet were those at Gibraltar, and their final death on the rock may have come as late as 32,500-30,000 BCE, or even 27,000-26,500 BCE, in isolation to judge by the markedly later arrival of modern groups to reuse their dwellings.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 116](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=112&annotation=4NJ9QEDS))
