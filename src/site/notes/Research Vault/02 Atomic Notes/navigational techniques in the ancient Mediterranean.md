“The only seagoing navigational aid known anywhere in the world before the ninth century AD is the sounding lead and its near relative, the sounding pole (2.1, 2.3, 2.7.6). The lead not only recorded the depth of water but also gave an indication of position from the nature of the sample of seabed recovered. Many leads have been found in inshore waters in the Mediterranean (Kapitan, 1969-71; Oleson, 1988; Grossmann, 1994), the oldest being that excavated from the Gela wreck of the late sixth/early fifth centuries BC (Oleson, 1994; Parker, 1992:188-9).”

“Homer's Odyssey contains a number of direct references, and many allusions to the navigational practices of his day (McGrail, 1996). Although Herodotus (2.53) believed that Homer lived 'not more than 400 years ago', i.e. the late ninth century BC, the version of the Homeric epics that has come down to us was probably written in the early seventh century (Osborne, 1996: 156-60). This saga is, however, the product of a long tradition and it is conceivable that the seafaring elements in the Odyssey reflect centuries-old practices. It is clear from many sections of the narrative that, although Odysseus had no sea chart as map, he had a 'mental chart' in his head, giving him the spatial relationships of the coastal lands and the islands of the eastern Mediterranean from the Ionian Sea to the shores of the Levant, Egypt, and Libya. From other passages in the Odyssey, a picture can be built up of the non-instrumental methods used at that time.”

#### Directions

“Odysseus also monitored the rising and setting of constellations such as Orion and the Pleiades, and prominent stars such as Arcturus (Odyssey, 5.270-5). This suggests that he had a detailed knowledge of the movements of the heavenly bodies, and could use this information to assist his direction keeping.” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 101](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=101&annotation=44XHINB3))

#### Distances

“As in many other maritime cultures Greek seamen in Odysseus' time measured distances at sea in units of a 'day's sail'. For example, Menelaus tells Telemachus that it is a day's sail f r o m the Nile to Pharos island 'for a well-found vessel in a fair wind' (Odyssey, 4.355-60).” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 102](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=102&annotation=I8LG6DWM))

#### Navigation on Voyages

“On exploration and settlement voyages in the tenth to seventh millennia BC, pilotage methods would have been used for as long as land was in sight. In fair weather, with good visibility, at around midsummer, on these particular routes, land would have been in sight, astern or ahead, throughout the voyage. As experience was built up so voyages could be undertaken in worse conditions when land was not always in sight . . .” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 102](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=102&annotation=7SQ89HKX))

“Signs of land over the horizon include: orographic cloud rising over distant land; colour changes in the water; land birds flying out to sea or back to the land. Once in sight of land, Odysseus identified natural land-marks such as Pharos island west of the River Nile or Psyria island when crossing the Aegean. We also learn from Homer that artificial landmarks were sometimes built. For example, the bones of Achilles, Menoetius, and Antilochus were buried under a mound on a foreland where it might be seen far out to sea by the sailors of today and future ages'.” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 102](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=102&annotation=9I7FD8LY))
