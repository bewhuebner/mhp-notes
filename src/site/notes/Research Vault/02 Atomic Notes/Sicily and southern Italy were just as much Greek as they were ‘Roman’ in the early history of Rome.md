“To all intents and purposes, much of the southern part of the peninsula, and [[Sicily\|Sicily]], was part of the Greek world, with a literate and artistic tradition linked to match. It is no coincidence that some of the earliest specimens of Greek writing to survive, maybe the very earliest, have actually been discovered there.” ([Location 1060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0108U7IHO&location=1060)) (page 85)
