#### Northern Routes

“The northern shores were thus more friendly to seafarers; this great advantage, and the fact that the European hinterland had greater economic potential, meant that, where there was a choice, northern, rather than southern, routes were preferred for east-west voyages.” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 95](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=95&annotation=7GKXI3JR))

#### Southern Routes

“The Nile delta was difficult to identify from seaward, except by its distinctive outflow and possibly in relation to the island of Pharos (2.11.1). A passage westwards had the added disadvantages that it was against the current, and also generally against the wind: only west of Cape Bon was there a reasonable chance of easterlies. The passage northwestwards through the Sicilians trait w a s especially difficult, often impossible, as it was against the predominant wind, and the foul current could at times reach 2-4 knots.” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 96](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=96&annotation=5AWA2IHA))

#### East/West Routes

“From Crete it is some 150-180 nautical miles, on a south-south-east heading, to the African coast—say, two days' sail with the wind on the starboard beam or quarter. Such a voyage is feasible. A direct return voyage was probably impossible if the departure point were east of Bay Al Bumbah, since the 'standard' ship used to evaluate these routes could not maintain a track closer to north than north-east: thus the eastern point of Crete would be left to port.” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=97&annotation=9HRK4793))

“From the south coast of Turkey or the northern Levant it was possible to sail direct to the Libyan coast , with the predominant wind on the starboard beam: this would have been the most southerly open-sea route. An alternative route was described b y Odysseus who told Eumaeus how he had sailed from the Levant in a Phoenician ship bound for Libya (Odyssey, 14: 300-5). In a northerly wind they 'took the central route and ran down the lee-side [i.e. the southern side] of Crete'. The implied northerly route would have been along the south coast of Asia Minor to Rhodes, then Crete. 

Odysseus (Rieu, 1946: 228) also noted that the voyage from Crete to Egypt took four days and nights (though some say three—Strabo, 10. 4. 5). This would have probably been with the north-west wind fine on the starboard quarter. A return direct to Crete was impossible in summer unless the vessel could tack even then it would have been a lengthy affair—as the track was almost directly into the predominant wind. In late spring, however, there was a 30 percent chance of a fair wind for the direct voyage. The alternative in summer, and probably also in late spring if the vessel could not tack, was the counter-clockwise coastal route.” ([McGrail, 2002, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/LVPZGRY3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85TAQ5UC?page=97&annotation=MPFPL2FV))
