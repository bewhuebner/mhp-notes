“The Canary Islands, about 1000 km (600 miles) from Gibraltar and 100 km (60 miles) off the nearest African shore, were certainly known by Roman times. [[Pliny the Elder\|Pliny the Elder]] described them, and relics from Roman landfalls have been found. We cannot accurately date the arrival of the ancestors of the Guanche people who first farmed this archipelago, without metals, until their slaughter by European adventurers halfway through the transition from crusading to trans-Atlantic conquest. But the circumstantial evidence points to sometime in the 1st millennium BCE and a northwest African origin – the Guanche language and genes have Berber links, and a ‘Neolithic’ technology could reflect conditions in parts of coastal Morocco even this late, if not a post-arrival loss of metallurgy in an island environment entirely without ores. Even Canarian house mice match with the wider contemporary invasion of the west Mediterranean by this species. Although the exact scenario may never be known, one likely context for the transfer of a mainly northwest African founding nucleus to the Canaries is the Atlantic seafaring exploits of 7th- to 6th-century Gadir.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 574](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=540&annotation=5IZDNARA))
