“With the demise of centralized palaces and international diplomacy, even the rudimentary protection that these provided in the east for people and goods on the move evaporated, and nothing comparable had ever existed further west. At first, the resultant freedom balanced the drawbacks, but as trade and interaction over former cultural boundaries boomed in the 8th century, the desirability of universal regulating mechanisms grew. Moreover, with the partial exception of Tyre, the Mediterranean’s shallow-rooted, fissile elites were ultimately failing, for all their material glory, to secure the numinous mantle attached to earlier eastern rulers – one of the factors that would gradually split off a secular political world from the transcendent realm, and equally widen personal access to the divine. The gods and their houses took on the roles of mediator and oath-binder, guarantor of qualities and quantities exchanged, secure haven for people and goods in transit, information bank and even lender of capital, reaping benefits in thanksgiving offerings and the dues from markets conducted under their protection. Shrines stuck out in emerging townscapes at this time, too, but with a few exceptions, those vital to Mediterranean connections tended to be less community-specific, more inclusive, and situated in neutral areas, often stopovers or way-finding points along sea-routes. They sacralized harbours, headlands, islands and isthmuses, replacing or adding to the local spirits, gods and monsters with which the sea had presumably always heaved.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 530](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=496&annotation=AAPZMLNU))

“Regardless of the details as to quite what went on at Corinth, it was there and elsewhere in the Aegean that such shrines in the end gained their greatest ascendancy, notably at Olympia in the western Peloponnese, on tiny Delos in the Cyclades, at Samos and Ephesus in the east and, of course, at oracular Delphi, recessed enough from the political map to give some credibility to its much-asserted neutrality, but conveniently placed above the Gulf of Corinth to pick up passing information and provide expert advice on overseas ventures.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 531](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=497&annotation=7CHBQZ3S))
