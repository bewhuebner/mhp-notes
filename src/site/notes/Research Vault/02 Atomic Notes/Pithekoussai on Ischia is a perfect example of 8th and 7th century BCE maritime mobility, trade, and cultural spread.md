“What of the remainder of the Mediterranean? Almost every theme worth exploring in the 8th and early 7th centuries BCE can be introduced via Pithekoussai, on the island of Ischia in the Bay of Naples. This remarkable site marks a further round of seagoing activity in the inviting embrace of Campania and its offshore islets, following Copper Age Gaudo-related activity, Bronze Age Vivara, and a series of early 1st-millennium coastal communities that are only now coming to light, one at Cumae and another, with 2nd-millennium BCE origins, at Poggiomarino, near Pompeii, perched on artificial islets in riverine wetland and active in the working of metals, amber and bone. In every sense Pithekoussai dwarfed these antecedents. Its cemeteries and large ridge-top settlement indicate that within a few generations the community grew from obscure origins to several thousand men, women and children, one of the biggest contemporary aggregations west of Cyprus, and one of the most ambitious small-island communities so far encountered beyond Phoenicia. Its composition was staggeringly diverse. People came from Campania, Etruria and Sardinia, the Aegean (primarily Euboea and Corinth – the latter on the ascendant, as we shall see), and a range of ‘Phoenician’ locales, but notably without signs of formal Tyrian affiliation.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 512](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=478&annotation=65FS8L96))

“Pithekoussai had a cosmopolitan, boom-town feel, and the primary lure was trade. Despite the number of imported pots and other goods, metals stood out as pre-eminent, especially Elban iron, whose ores were so pure that they were worth shipping overseas for smelting. . . . Its Greek name may adapt an indigenous or Phoenician original but translates as ‘Monkey Island’, an allusion to exotic places, whether by this time Egypt (baboons), northeast Africa in general (vervets) or the Maghreb (barbary apes), but also with connotations of imitation, persuasive chatter and encounters with creatures not quite like oneself. Its Latin name, Aenaria, referenced metals, currency and sea-travelling Aeneas. This island community is a touchstone, as its names imply, for wider themes: maritime mobility, Iron Age trade, the spread of the alphabet, the consumers of an evermore interconnected Mediterranean culture, the growth of large communities in new places and, last but not least, the creation of long-term bases far from home for substantial numbers of people.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 512](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=479&annotation=M2ZI7NB5))

“Pithekoussai testifies to a continued growth in shipping, which brought countless people, goods and materials to and from Ischia, and, along with farms dotted across the island, must have kept its inhabitants fed with imported food, presumably from Campania. Boats leapt back into visibility from the 8th century BCE, in media as varied as Assyrian royal reliefs, painted pottery and metal firedogs twisted into galley outlines, as if the men gathered around the hearth bonded through the crewing of such craft. Wrecks further testify to an increase in both traffic and archaeologically visible commodities as well as the enduring dangers of even a shrunken sea. The most impressive are two ships lost 50 km (30 miles) off [[Ashkelon shipwreck\|Ashkelon]] around 750 BCE, and detected by pioneering deep-sea techniques 400 m (1300 ft) beneath the waves, their combined total of some 800 amphorae (about 15,000 litres or 3300 gallons of liquid cargo) still delineating the hulls on the seabed. Unless their all but exclusive focus on liquid transport is a bias resulting from their incomplete, remotely controlled investigation, it contrasts with the mixed nature of earlier, and most later, cargos, and may reflect how regular the Levantine wine trade with nearby markets such as Egypt had become. Whatever the truth about maximum cargos in the Bronze Age, during the Iron Age these attained 70-80 tonnes, though there is no sign of the supersized bulk transports, of as much as 500 tonnes in capacity, reported as marvels in Roman and medieval times (an interesting, if currently unanswerable, question is the antiquity of the tendency, evident by medieval times, to deploy larger sails in the more open spaces of the western Mediterranean).
