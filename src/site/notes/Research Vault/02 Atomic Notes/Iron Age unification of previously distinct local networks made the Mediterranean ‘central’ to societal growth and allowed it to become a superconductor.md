“For all these exceptions, the implications and consequences for Mediterranean history of the link-up revealed at Huelva possess a strategic quality that should not be lost in the detail. Previously, the sea had been becoming central to sizeable fragments of the Mediterranean basin; now it began to form the centre of the whole. In aggregate distance (if not uninterrupted crossings) the first voyages along the length of the basin stand out as global record-breakers for their time, and the culmination of a late 2nd-millennium BCE outstripping of Pacific performances that had held the lead since seagoing began. They also ushered in renewed symmetry to the Mediterranean, on a cultural level exemplified by the Levantine balance weights dug from Huelva’s mud, which number among the first of many introduced or otherwise shared practices that would draw the basin together in coming centuries, and in terms of maritime space restoring the equality in scale first distorted by the Byblos ships of the 3rd millennium BCE. In this second sense symmetry went hand in hand with drastic shrinkage. The Neolithic Mediterranean had been uniformly if unimaginably vast, that of the Copper and Bronze ages more variably so, but the Iron Age Mediterranean was simply large and, as such, potentially knowable in its entirety and so claimable, too, as ‘our sea’. To illustrate the transformation, a reasonably lucky one-way passage of the basin’s length in the Iron Age is thought to have taken about three months, with a biennial return often imposed by seasonal weather, while the Neolithic version of this axial route took several millennia to convey farming from one end of the basin to the other, a duration beyond even collective memory. As we shall see, this shrinkage in turn powered up both centrifugal and centripetal tendencies in the basin’s networks, as the entire sea turned superconductor, forging the cultural and economic conditions for a subsequent pan-Mediterranean empire that would unify the basin politically for the first (and last) time, while extending its reach also into Europe, Africa and Asia.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 505](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=472&annotation=35MEDXLT))
