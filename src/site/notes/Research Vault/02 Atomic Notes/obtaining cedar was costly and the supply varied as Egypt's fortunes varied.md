“Mikesell points out that when Egypt was a powerful, tribute-demanding state (as in the Old Kingdom, Dynasty 12, and Dynasty 18), huge amounts of cedar were cut for the Egyptians and sent to Egypt, but that in Dynasty 21, Wenamun experienced great difficulties getting lumber for the ceremonial ship of Amun-Re. Wenamun obtained seven logs, but then had to provide jars of gold and silver, rolls of linen and papyrus, cowhides, ropes, lentils, and fish before the Syrian prince arranged for three hundred men and oxen to cut and haul the remaining timber.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=31&annotation=L97NTILV))
