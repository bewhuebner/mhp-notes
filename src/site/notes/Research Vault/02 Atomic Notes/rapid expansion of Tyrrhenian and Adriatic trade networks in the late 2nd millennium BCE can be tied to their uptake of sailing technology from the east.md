“To attribute all this flow to return cargos in eastern ships seems absurd; after all, the Aegean by the 12th century had reverted to a social and economic par with regions to its west, and Cyprus, though more dynamic, was too distant a player in Tyrrhenian and Adriatic waters to account for the entire pattern. Some of this eastward transfer (as well as a continued westward flow of eastern things) was very likely effected by people of central Mediterranean origin, some on the move as mercenaries or settlers, but most as tramping traders or raiders of the kind equally on the rise further east, whose networks they seamlessly expanded into – a web of coastal and island people covering two-thirds of the basin.

The fast-expanding horizons of such central Mediterranean people must have had a lot to do with local uptakes of sailing technology after several centuries of exposure to eastern designs. As noted in Chapter 8, dates for this uptake are hard to pin down; Sardinian boat models dating to the 8th, 9th and possibly 10th centuries BCE show masts mounted on rounded, deckless hulls, and later wreck remains imply that a tradition of sewn planking survived and influenced the transition as sailing ship construction went native. Yet the coastal entrepots of the central Mediterranean were so adept at adopting novelties as diverse as the potter’s wheel, rectangular buildings, olive cultivation and donkeys, that efforts at building sailing ships over the last few centuries of the 2nd millennium are exceedingly plausible, especially as nautical technology downscaled into variants demanding less capital investment. Egyptian indications of sail-borne people hailing in part from regions to the west may therefore have some truth to them, if not necessarily as understood by the pharaohs. The overall ‘Shardana’ phenomenon in fact makes excellent sense as a mingling of native fighting and voyaging traditions in the centre of the basin, sea-shrinking eastern sail technology, and the rising ethos of the *caboteur*.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 472-73](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=440&annotation=9P9ZLA8M))
