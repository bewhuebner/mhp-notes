“Polybius, a high-born Greek intellectual of the 2nd century BCE, held not unpleasantly as a hostage in Rome for his compatriots’ good behaviour, opined in the great work he wrote there that only since about 220 BCE had history (by which he meant political history, and of the Mediterranean basin and its neighbours) possessed a truly woven-together, interactive unity. His choice of date signified the moment when Rome’s drive to conquer really took off beyond Italy and the Tyrrhenian Sea, reaching swiftly to the Balkans and Spain. In fact, as we have seen, long before its political history drew together, the Mediterranean was already an integrated, dynamic nexus of culturally convergent societies and economies, politically independent yet in every other sense interdependent, structured around a set of increasingly shared or easily convertible standards (citizens, coins, alphabets and Greek-style drinking vessels, to mention but a recent few), and all operating within an even older ecological whole.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 578](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=544&annotation=P8DGT7TS))
