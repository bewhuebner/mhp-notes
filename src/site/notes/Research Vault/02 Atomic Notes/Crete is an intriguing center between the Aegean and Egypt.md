The strongest and most unexpected contrast is one which became established between the north-and south-facing coasts of the island: the former looking to the nearby coasts and islands of the Aegean, the latter looking out towards distant Africa, Cyrenaica and above all Egypt.

Swallows come there to winter, as they do in Egypt. ([LocationÂ 2316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004FEFSCC&location=2316)) (Braudel 2001, p. 109)
