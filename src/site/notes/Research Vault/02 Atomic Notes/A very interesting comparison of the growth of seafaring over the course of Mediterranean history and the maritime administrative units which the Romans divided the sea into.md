“If we plot the infilling of the basin’s blue parts by human traffic over time, the cumulative rise of the sea as the real centre of the Mediterranean stands out clearly. Intriguingly, when we compare this with the administrative units into which Rome would later divide the Mediterranean’s waters (an imposition itself redolent of supreme bureaucratic confidence on the empire’s part), we see that the latter reflected not just physical geography, but also the phantom outlines and evolutionary histories of older maritime connections that we have traced, in a few cases right back to the end of the Pleistocene.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 597](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=555&annotation=KPDL6MIC))
