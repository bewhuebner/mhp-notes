“Standing back a little, the conventional division of the Mediterranean at this juncture into Phoenician and Greek spheres appears to reflect not so much archetypal differences as younger ones emerging via contemporary webs of interaction.

But Greekness, in the Aegean and further afield, is an equally good example of the alternative strand of ethnic formation, via differentiation, in this case from the many other (literally) disorienting kinds of people encountered. Principal among these were Phoenicians, ironically a collective that we owe to Greek, and whose Aegean connotations were deeply ambivalent. Alluring as they were to elites eager to join the wider world of exotic goods and practices, Phoenicians presented an alarming prospect for others of the middling sort, especially agrarian or less travelled people (of whom there undoubtedly remained many), for whom the explicitly mercantile, culturally deracinated practices refined in the east since the Bronze Age seemed dangerously wily (shades of the ‘corrupting sea’) – a defensive stance that ossified into prejudice in later Classical thought and, thanks to the latter’s impact on Western elites over 2000 years later, colours attitudes to trade and stokes anti-Semitism to this day. During the 8th century BCE, and for some time thereafter, intimations of Greek identity were faint, ambiguous and countered by elite cosmopolitanism, although even the latter gradually evolved a Hellenic guise. Such stirrings were quite widespread on the fringes of Phoenician engagement. On Cyprus, Sargon II’s stele at Kition could have stirred up resentment elsewhere on this hitherto tolerant island, as evinced by its uptake of Aegean trappings and retention of indigenous syllabic scripts. ‘Etruscan’ as both an ethnic and written phenomenon reflects similar reactions in the Tyrrhenian region, and in southwest Iberia offerings of eastern-type goods at earlier Copper Age tombs hint at attempts to control and render native the power of foreign things.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 533-34](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=500&annotation=CLANIG2B))
