“Obsidian first appears at Franchthi in levels characterized by a diet almost as parlous as that of a hippopotamus-less Aetokremnos, with decreases in land mammals and fish, vast numbers of snails and shifts in marine molluscs. Crossing distances to Melos from Attica, the nearest mainland, via hops through the western Cyclades, were 15-20 km (10-12 miles) apiece (plus intervening coastwise travel), again similar to the present. A more direct hazardous open-sea route with jumps of up to 35 km (22 miles) ran southeast from Franchthi via then shrinking or drowning islets west of the Cyclades, though the tiny quantities of obsidian cast doubt on whether Franchthi was procuring directly or from undiscovered intermediaries. The individual crossing distances on neither route rival those to Cyprus, but the sum totals are higher, as much as 250-300 km (150-185 miles) via Attica, with return journeys to be considered. Moreover, as was long ago pointed out, but ==we are surely only spotting the tip of an iceberg, for this discovery of the two Melian outcrops of obsidian in the midst of a complex archipelago only makes sense as the outcome of a more thoroughgoing maritime exploration of the Aegean that has otherwise left almost no trace.”== ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 152-53](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=141&annotation=M3EFCNFF))

“Now, however, we know that the earliest Melian obsidian was obtained in the 11th millennium BCE, and perhaps slightly earlier within that millennium than at Aetokremnos. It is a shock to realize that both these fall in the depths of the Younger Dryas (10,700-9600 BCE), that drastic return to cold, arid conditions and a chilly sea no longer encroaching on coastal territory. If this correlation is broadly sustained – and slightly earlier finds cannot be ruled out – ==Mediterranean seafaring began in hard not halcyon times, and this in turn forces a rethink as to why people started to practise it. Humans as much as hippopotami were under stress, and one likely answer is a search for refuges that would enable members of a recently booming population to survive as prospects deteriorated.” ==([Broodbank, 2013, p. 154](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=141&annotation=8RZHANFL))

“What began as a short-term response to crisis conditions became locked in as a longer-term practice, as amply revealed by ongoing acquisition of Melian obsidian long after the Younger Dryas had faded into memory, plus a crescendo of seafaring from early in the Holocene that built upon the cumulative legacy of maritime knowledge. From this juncture, we no longer need to ask whether seafaring existed to any serious degree in the Mediterranean, and instead can begin to enquire where it was being practised, by whom, and to what ends and effects.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 155](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=142&annotation=FMY48Y8E))

The first good evidence for short sea-crossings comes during the Upper Palaeolithic (the late ‘Old Stone Age’), that is, before about 11000 BC. At this point, visitors set foot on Melos in the Greek Cyclades, in search of the volcanic glass obsidian, used in stone tools, and offering sharper edges than flint. Sicily has yielded dozens of Palaeolithic sites from the same period, very often along the coast, where settlers consumed large quantities of molluscs, though they also hunted foxes, hare and deer. They took care of the dead, covering the body with a layer of ochre and sometimes burying the corpses with decorated necklaces.
