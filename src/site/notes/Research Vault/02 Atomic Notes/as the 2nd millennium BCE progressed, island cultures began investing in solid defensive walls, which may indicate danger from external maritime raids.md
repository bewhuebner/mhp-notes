“Yet times had changed, and even remote islands with minimal external traffic were no longer safely protected by their expanses of surrounding sea. During the 2nd millennium BCE practically every small-island community of any note in the southern part of the central Mediterranean ensured a location on a naturally defended hilltop or promontory, and piled up crude fortifications. In the Aeolians this trend began between 1800 and 1500 BCE and ended with a population nucleated on Lipari’s acropolis. On Pantelleria, Mursia constructed defences 7 m (23 ft) high within the same time span, I Faraglioni on Ustica was surrounded by a bastioned wall, and a hulking line was thrown up at Borg in-Nadur on Malta. These were heavy investments of labour for small island populations. The most likely explanation is that sightings of strange boats had started to spell danger as much as opportunity. Perhaps that danger was still no more than a raid by a neighbour’s war canoe – the Cycladic islanders had, after all, likewise fortified their homes during their own crescendo of canoe traffic almost a thousand years earlier – but the timing among several hitherto more remote central Mediterranean islands raises the possibility that this time the cause for alarm was not merely familiar canoes but the flash of a foreign sail on the horizon.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 430-31](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=407&annotation=8BHK6UKM))
