“Analogies for such an approach come less from writing than orchestral music, in which, within a coherent whole, themes interweave over time, coming and going in various keys or picked up by different instruments, or such paintings as the avowedly symphonic later canvases of Kandinsky and the creations of *pointillisme*, in which innumerable dots glow in miniature, while combining to create patchworks of related colours and, when we step far enough back, a grander overall image.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 80](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=78&annotation=75LNAEPY))
