“Much of what tied this world together remained commercial transactions. Except in Levantine waters, the later 7th and 6th centuries saw a further burgeoning of trade, and the final realization of a Mediterranean-wide market, already partly interdependent and governed by the regime of cheap maritime transport costs, specialist production and extensive importation, plus the attendant threats of short-circuiting, undercutting and substitution, that had arisen over the 2nd millennium BCE in the east and survived there in a few economic refuges ever since. The later 7th century BCE saw the peak of the Phoenician network in the west, streamlined by internal competition towards a limited number of major operators, primarily Gadir but also new foundations such as Malaka. This concentration, plus the native Iberian elite’s uptake of viticulture during the 6th century BCE, in their own quest for Mediterranean-style consumption, wealth and status, spelt the end for smaller Phoenician ventures in the eponymous Malaga bay. Meanwhile, connections in the Tyrrhenian region were being heavily reshaped by Etruscan sea trade, which expanded decisively throughout this period, adopting as its culture hero one Utuzte (Latin Ulysses). Its foci were Elban iron and the export to adjacent regions of the products of another now well-established local oil and wine industry, alongside those of southern Iberia, southern Italy and Sicily.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 546](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=512&annotation=E6H9NI52))
