“What particularly distinguishes Horizon III from the earlier (and later) horizons are the numerous and varied images that can be explained in terms of royal ideology. This is preeminently the case for a number of boat-drawings that belong to Types II and XV. These vessels, having close counterparts on Terminal Predynastic and Early Dynastic elite artifacts (e.g., the famous Narmer Palette and the Gebel el-Arak knife handle), can in all probability be considered as ships of state or royal procession barges, which symbolically express the dominion of the ruler. Some of these depictions may even have been executed in commemoration of the actual periodic passage of a royal ship and the human figures on board may represent the the skillful royal helmsmen. The concept of regal power and triumph is probably also embodied in a number of individual animal representations, including wild (‘raging’) bulls, vultures and scorpions, all of which are recognized bestial allegories of kingship.” ([Huyge, 2002, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CGK3ASIT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B2GXX254?page=11&annotation=EJHDKAC2))
