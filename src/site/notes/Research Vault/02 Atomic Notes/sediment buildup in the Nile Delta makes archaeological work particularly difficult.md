#### Broodbank

“Our Mediterranean perspective focuses particular attention on the great fertile triangle where the [[Nile\|Nile]] intercepts the sea. The problem is that the archaeology of this crucial deltaic interface lies under a thick blanket of river silt and much of it beneath the water table, creating problems first of detection and then logistical ones for excavation.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=39&annotation=29DF8DVR))

#### Braudel

In the Paleolithic era, there began a long period of sedimentation, which was also responsible for the layers of ancient alluvial mud, the soils reddened by iron oxide. Between 30,000 and 10,000 B.C., the Nile flowed more abundantly than in the time of the Pharaohs, and accumulated its greatest volumes of mud.

#### Wilkinson

Yet our modern understanding of the delta still lags far behind that of the Nile Valley. The main reasons are the steady accumulation of silt over centuries, burying many of the ancient remains, and the area’s difficult and uncompromising terrain.
