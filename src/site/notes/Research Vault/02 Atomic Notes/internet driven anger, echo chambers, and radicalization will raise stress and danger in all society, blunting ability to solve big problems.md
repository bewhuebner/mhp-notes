If we are lost in lies, and constantly riled up to be angry with our fellow citizens, this sets off a chain reaction. It means we can’t understand what is really going on. In those circumstances, we can’t solve our collective challenges. This means our wider problems will get worse. As a result, the society won’t just feel more dangerous—it will actually be more dangerous. Things will start to break down. And as real danger rises, we will become more and more vigilant.
