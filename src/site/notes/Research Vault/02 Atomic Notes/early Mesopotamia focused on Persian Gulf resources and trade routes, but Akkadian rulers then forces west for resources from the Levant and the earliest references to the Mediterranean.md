“Early in the 3rd millennium BCE, Mesopotamia’s focus shifted to the south, via the Persian Gulf to copper sources in Oman and a sea-route to the emergent Harappan cities of the Indus Valley. Currently landlocked Ur, with its famous royal tombs, was a port for this trade, on a coastline that then thrust far inland. Levantine contacts carried on via intermediaries on the Euphrates, but only with the late 3rd-millennium BCE hegemony of Akkad did the west again figure prominently in Mesopotamian geopolitics. The desire to establish access to metal sources, and now also cedar wood, was the stimulus, and cities in northern Syria were devastated along the way. The ‘silver mountain’ referred to in Akkadian texts denotes the Taurus.”  ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 284-85](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=262&annotation=9SMI4NSH))

“It is in this context that we find the earliest Mesopotamian reference to the Mediterranean, or the small fragment of it that Akkadian expeditions encountered and named an Upper Sea, juxtaposed with their Lower Sea of the Persian Gulf, and facing which Sargon claimed to have erected images of himself. No trace of these has ever been found, but surviving Akkadian monuments in this genre give some idea of what may have once looked out over the lapis-blue waters of the Gulf of Iskenderun.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 285](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=262&annotation=9SMI4NSH))
