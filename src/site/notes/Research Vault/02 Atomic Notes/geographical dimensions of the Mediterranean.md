“The Mediterranean Sea extends some 3800 km (2350 miles) east to west and between 750 and 400 km (460 and 250 miles) north to south. At 2.5 million sq. km (965,000 sq. miles), it makes up less than one per cent of the world’s marine space.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=54&annotation=HCUPIX7S))
