“One part of west Anatolia that cropped up regularly in royal archives is [[Lukka\|Lukka]], which corresponds to Lycia, the mountain massif hanging over Turkey’s south coast, and off whose cliffs the Uluburun ship met its doom. Lukka is intriguing because it does not comply with expectations. External references to it named neither kings nor capital, referred to no treaties, and portrayed it as an ungoverned space that bred trouble for others on land and sea. An Amarna letter complained of Lukka raids on the Delta, with the intriguing insinuation of Cypriot encouragement - peevishly denied by whoever replied from Cyprus, complaining of similar attacks. Lycian archaeology proves similarly elusive, for the excavations at later Iron Age to Roman towns such as Tlos and Xanthos (Lycian Arnna), whose names correspond to places mentioned at Hattusa, have drawn an almost complete Bronze Age blank. However we populate Lukka in our imagination, with sturdy mountaineers, sea-raiders, or both and more, the point is that it represented a substantial capsule of non-palatial, maybe non-urban and presumably rudely non-Akkadian-conversant people within the polite circle of the east Mediterranean, and one that survived very well on its own” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 412](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=388&annotation=U623KIMG))
