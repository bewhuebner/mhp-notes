“most hunter-gatherers followed the herds to live out on extended coastal plains, where their archaeology is largely lost to us. Daring exploration of now-submarine caves off Marseilles confirms that an apparent lack of people in Provence is due to the fact that most lived in landscapes currently beneath the sea, and in rugged regions like the Aegean such exposed tracts comprised a high proportion of all usable lowland.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 122](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=118&annotation=3MJ827QX))

The Cosquer grotto near Marseilles contains carvings by homo sapiens from as early as 27000 BC and paintings earlier than 19000 BC; it now lies well below sea level, but when it was inhabited the Mediterranean shore lay a few miles further out.
