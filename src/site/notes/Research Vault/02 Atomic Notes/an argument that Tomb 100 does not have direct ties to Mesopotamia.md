“The continued insistence that the black boat is of the same type  as or even similar to Mesopotamian craft has never been substantiated. As for the black boat, no evidence exists that Mesopotamians of the Late Uruk period ever  used a boat that has one extremity so much higher than the other. Furthermore, it becomes difficult to accept the view that the black boat is of a foreign type when no  agreement can be reached as to which end is the bow and which is the stern.” ([Mark, 1998, p. 79](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=88&annotation=9VD2Q7HZ))
