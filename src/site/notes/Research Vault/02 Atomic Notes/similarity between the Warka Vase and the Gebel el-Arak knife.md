“An abstraction of this kind can be made concrete through a comparison of the Warka vase and the Gebel el-Arak knife. What is shared between them is not religious scruple, but visual formulas and select elements of visual vocabulary. In the case of the knife, the images are used to articulate a fundamental, entirely Egyptian conception of kingship that may have been reenacted as a ritual, a ritual that has nothing at all in common with the ritual represented on the Warka vase. During the several generations between the Gebel el-Arak knife handle and the Narmer Palette, Egypt developed along lines remarkably different from those that can be reconstructed for the Sumerian society of southern Mesopotamia. In Egypt, Narmer is divine king. In Mesopotamia, the institution of kingship is only gradually consolidated in response to increasing competition for resources in the alluvial plain. It is hard to find convincing evidence for Moorey's notion of "shared religious scruple" between the two civilizations. Instead, the evidence is that both societies developed, along divergent lines, unique systems of social organization; each recognized and developed ideas of value useful for its own purposes, consistent with its own cultural principles.” ([Pittman, 1996, p. 27](zotero://select/library/items/9JWSTRSK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NK3CST2Q?page=20&annotation=47QLRC3Y))>)
