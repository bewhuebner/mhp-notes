“[[Darius I\|Darius I]] (522–486 B.C.E.) Darius’s accession to the Persian throne was greeted with rebellions in all quarters of his kingdom. His subsequent triumph over the rebels was celebrated in an inscription carved on the sheer face of a cliff overlooking Behistun (Bisitun) in Media. The inscriptioN—in Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian—became the equivalent to Egypt’s Rosetta Stone, offering modern scholars the key to the decipherment of Mesopotamia’s cuneiform writing system. Darius also built a new capital city and grandiose palace at Persepolis, as well as constructing an arsenal and an expanded royal residence at Babylon. In addition, he reorganized the administration of his empire to give himself greater control, established a system of royal roads and messengers for efficient communication, and imposed a universal code of law and standard of currency throughout his realm. It was he who made Aramaic (instead of Akkadian) the official language of Mesopotamia and the rest of his Near Eastern empire. His greatest foreign policy success was his domination of Egypt; his signal failure, his military defeat at the hand of the Greeks at Marathon in 490 B.C.E.” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 83](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=96&annotation=9IH8EWHT))
