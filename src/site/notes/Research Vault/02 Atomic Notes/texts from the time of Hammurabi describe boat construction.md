A governor from the time of Hammurabi urges one of his subordinates to hasten the building of a boat: “Deliver [to the boatbuilder] the grain and dates he will request from you for the reed-weavers and other unskilled workers.” To another boatbuilder in the same yard at Larsa he writes: “assemble whatever boards and beams are needed to build a barge.” So at this period, both timber and reeds were being used to make boats.
