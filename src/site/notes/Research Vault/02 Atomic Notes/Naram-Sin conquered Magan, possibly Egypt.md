“he brought booty from Magan after defeating its king Manium, whom some scholars have identified with the renowned Menes of Egypt. No wonder that he felt himself powerful enough to add the epithet 'King of the four quarters" to his titulary and that he was presumptuous enough to have himself deified as "the god of Agade” ([Kramer, 1963, p. 62](zotero://select/library/items/TI24BNVH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EY8R4485?page=62&annotation=R69RVMSV))

### Summary of Naram-Sin‘s life

“Naram-Sin (2254–2218 B.C.E.) The grandson of Sargon of Akkad, Naram-Sin conducted military campaigns along his kingdom’s farflung borders, regaling himself with the title “King of the Four Quarters (of the Earth)” and calling himself divine. A stela now in the Louvre shows him proudly ascending a mountain in triumph over his enemies. Tradition declares that his overweening pride angered the gods, who chastised him for his hubris.” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=110&annotation=S7KLZLTL))
