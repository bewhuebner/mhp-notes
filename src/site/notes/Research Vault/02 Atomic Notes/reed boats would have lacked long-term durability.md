“Just how effective reed craft would have been for longer journeys, given their penchant to become waterlogged even when coated with tar, is an open question. In anything but calm water, they would have been difficult to handle. Almost certainly, anyone coasting seriously in the Gulf would have needed a wooden-hulled ship.” ([Fagan, 2012, p. 118](zotero://select/library/items/YUMUCT4Z)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IL7KTQZ2?page=118&annotation=WDW92LPV))
