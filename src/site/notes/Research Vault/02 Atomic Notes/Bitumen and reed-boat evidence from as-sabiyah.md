“The remains of one such asphalt-coated craft have come to light at As-Sabiyah, in Kuwait, dating to between 5300 and 4900 B.C.E. The tar-encrusted reeds even bear traces of the barnacles that once clung to the hull. Supplies of the asphalt traveled considerable distances.” ([Fagan, 2012, p. 118](zotero://select/library/items/YUMUCT4Z)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IL7KTQZ2?page=118&annotation=DSL5KDY9))
