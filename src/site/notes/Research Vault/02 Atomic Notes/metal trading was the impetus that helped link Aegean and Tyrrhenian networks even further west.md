“During the middle centuries of the 2nd millennium BCE Aegean pottery began to appear in the central Mediterranean. It started as a trickle at select sites but gradually grew in numbers and spread. The trading communities there were quite active and inured enough to receiving people and goods from over the sea to allow us to reject the old chauvinism that it took mariners from the east to awaken indigenous economies, and we can again recall that one precursor, the Cetina expansion, was initiated from the central part of the basin. But this does not reduce the significance of this new linkage between pre-existing networks in the Aegean and Tyrrhenian, which was soon to be extended up the Adriatic, east to Cyprus and west to Sardinia to create a bipolar ‘route of the islands’, closely implicated in metal trading. Despite subsequent ups and downs, and changes in the frameworks of engagement over time, this was a leap in the scope of connections, a permanent shift in Mediterranean history and a crucial stage in tying together the basin’s inhabitants across a soon-to-be shrinking sea.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 431](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=407&annotation=CXUDTNFQ))
