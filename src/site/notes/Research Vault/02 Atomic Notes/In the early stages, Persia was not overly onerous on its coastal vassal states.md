“Thanks to the number of its coastal vassals, Persia conjured up war-fleets of unparalleled size - indeed the first triremes may have been built to its specifications. In 525 BCE the Persian call for Egyptian surrender at Memphis was made from the deck of a ship of Lesbos; slightly later, a coastal geography of the Aegean, presumably a *periplous* of some description, was written to imperial order by a team cruising around it in Sidonian ships. Persian kings’ determination to surpass decisively the Upper Sea bounds of Mesopotamian lordship may also cast light, alongside more prosaic rationales, on their persistent amphibious operations in the Aegean. And despite its resort to overwhelming force when it met resistance (which drove some east Aegean dwellers, including another generation of Phocaeans, to relocate far to the west), and its unexceptional policy of forced relocation (which saw others re-employed at Persepolis), the Persian empire reverted in its Mediterranean territories to the light touch that had served Assyria so well. It adapted its tribute and taxation arrangements to maritime realities, fostered recovery in the Levant and encouraged coastal towns in general to prosper, albeit with the teeth drawn from their politics under local rulers chosen from their own elite and responsible to provincial satraps. Greek pots returned in force to the Levant, as ever betraying other normally invisible flows, such as a vast consignment of purple cloth from the Argolid still stored in the palace at Susa when Alexander got there in 331 BCE, and said to have been delivered 190 years earlier. Quite unlike the explicitly thalassocentric projects already emerging at Carthage and soon at Athens, the Persian empire remained typical of the pragmatic, if often grudging, cohabitation between major land powers and the Mediterranean’s maritime cities for centuries to come.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 584](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=550&annotation=G9AW4EG5))
