“The Mycenaean leadership’s addiction to fighting and ostentatious burial (the shaft graves now largely replaced by round, corbelled tholos tombs) argues for an up-scaled version of the small, competitive elites common over much of Mediterranean Europe since the 3rd millennium BCE, legitimized and entrenched thanks to cultural drapery and economic practices borrowed with varying degrees of fidelity from Crete and further east, and given some procedural gravitas by a basic level of literacy, again externally acquired. One advantage is that Linear B can be read, but the fact that the fire-preserved tablets for the entire kingdom of Pylos amount to just twice the number from the largest private merchant’s archive at Ugarit reins in expectations. Linear B tablets focused narrowly on internal palatial matters. They reveal command economies well-attuned, within a limited remit, to Mediterranean conditions, and concentrated on large-scale production of woollen and linen textiles, perfumed oil, wine and, to a lesser degree, bronze. 

As usual, many of these goods circulated internally, but plenty were also for export, and the archives allude to a wider world through reference to exotic materials, Semitic loanwords for gold, ivory, cumin and sesame, and people or things described as Tyrian, of Beirut, Cypriot or Egyptian. Otherwise, however, a resounding textual silence surrounds trade. Combined with the infrequent, tangential nature of external mentions of the Aegean (which leave some doubt as to how often its rulers attained the wider acknowledgment they seemed to yearn for), this leaves us overwhelmingly in the realm of archaeology when it comes to discerning patterns of contacts between the Aegean and regions further east.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 410](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=386&annotation=PVKEMDY7))
