“In some cases, even learned Roman lawyers misunderstood what they read in the Twelve Tables. The idea that a defaulting debtor who had several creditors could be put to death and his body divided between them, in appropriately sized pieces, according to the amount owed, looks like one such misunderstanding (or so many modern critics have hoped).” ([Location 1863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0108U7IHO&location=1863)) (page 142)

- There are some eery similarities between this tendency to revere Rome’s ‘original laws’ and the way that modern U.S. conservatives worship the Constitution.
