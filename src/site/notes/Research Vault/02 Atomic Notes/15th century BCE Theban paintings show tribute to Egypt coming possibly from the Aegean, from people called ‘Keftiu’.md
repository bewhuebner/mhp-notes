“Contemporary Theban tombs show processions bringing what can be flexibly translated, in the spirit of later Amarna, as tribute or gifts, borne by Canaanites, Mesopotamians, Nubians and, most significant in the present context, ‘Keftiu’ with Aegean clothing and hairstyles, oxhide ingots, bolts of cloth, elephant tusks and flower-adorned metal vessels and animal­ headed ritual shapes. Do these echo Cretan expeditions to the court of a world-conquering king, just as one of Japan’s early rulers dispatched a 140-strong seaborne embassy to Tang China? Perhaps, but contacts remained episodic. Later Egyptian writings continue to mention Keftiu (albeit in one medical papyrus, copied from an earlier original, in the context of a curative spell purportedly in the language of Keftiu but in fact gibberish), while ‘Tanaja’, thought to designate the Greek mainland, and the ‘Isles of [[the Great Green\|the Great Green]]’ also appear.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 403-4](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=379&annotation=G6PCILQL))
