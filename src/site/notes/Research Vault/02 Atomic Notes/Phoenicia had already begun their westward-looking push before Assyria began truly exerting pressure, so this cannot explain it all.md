“The more specific argument that rapacious Assyrian tribute demands goaded Phoenician cities to reach far to the west to obtain precious metals, especially silver, that could appease or buy resistance to their overlords has much to recommend it for the 8th and 7th centuries, by which time Assyria was reconstituted as an empire of unprecedented size, territorial integration and extractive power. But in the 9th century the reforms that would effect this had yet to translate into reality away from their Mesopotamian epicentre. At the time when the first Levantine links to the far west were being forged, Assyria’s own records reveal its raids and tribute to have been still essentially Bronze Age in flavour. Lists and images reel off an eclectic mixture of bullion, metal vessels, precious stones, textiles, ivory, animal skins and birds, all sporadic in incidence, with decadal gaps during the 9th century BCE and a lengthier interruption at the start of the 8th century. Costly as they certainly were for those at the receiving end, such extractions were no worse than prosperous cities on the sea had endured at the hands of Egypt and Hatti.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 491](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=458&annotation=HXSBI7XE))
