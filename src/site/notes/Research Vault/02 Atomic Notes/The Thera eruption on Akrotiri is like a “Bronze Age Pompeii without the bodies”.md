“The eruption of the Thera volcano bequeathed to us at Akrotiri a Bronze Age Pompeii without the bodies, and conditions of preservation we have to thank repeatedly in the course of this chapter.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 371](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=347&annotation=62SPRYTR))

“A traditional date in the late 16th century BCE is challenged by radiocarbon, and by signatures of an event that may, or may not, be attributable to Thera in the Greenland ice and tree-ring growth across the northern hemisphere, which are collectively argued to support a date a century earlier, perhaps as precise as 1628/7 BCE (though each has its attendant problems).” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 372](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=348&annotation=TR7T5DU3))
