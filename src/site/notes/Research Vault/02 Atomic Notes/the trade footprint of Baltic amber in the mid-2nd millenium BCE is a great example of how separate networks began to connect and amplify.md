“The most visible tracer, however, is amber, a strange, sun-coloured material with magical static if rubbed (hence its Greek name, elektron). This spread south into the Mediterranean from sources in the Baltic, soon ousting an inferior and sporadically locally employed Sicilian variety. Some of the pieces from the Mycenae shaft graves had been carved in central Europe into specific forms of spacer beads that also reached the barrows of southern England; another piece, carved into a scarab, lay near the heart of Tutankhamun. Changes in the routes that amber took from the Baltic illustrate how shifting regional networks within the Mediterranean shaped and altered longer-range connections beyond it, in this case drawing amber into the basin first via Carpathian communities, but later further west, towards the Tyrrhenian. For Aegean people, the latter, western point of encounter with its glowing yellow nodules may lie behind the myth of the golden apples of the Hesperides.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 431-32](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=408&annotation=9HGXHW6L))
