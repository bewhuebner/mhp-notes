“The name “Mesopotamia” is, in fact, a misnomer: many of the land’s ancient cities were located not between the two rivers but just outside the edge of the irregular spearpoint they form as they aim southeast to the sea.” ([Bertman, 2003, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/YPMHZBXL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X3CHJ4P3?page=17&annotation=CWYZYRF5))
