“Thutmose III or Hatshepsut must have authorized ships from [[Keftiu\|Keftiu]] (Crete) to tie up at the port of [[Avaris\|Avaris]]—they’re mentioned in the dockyard records of the city. Minoan “chiefs” were sending gifts to Egyptian kings at around this time; they’re depicted carrying vessels in familiar Minoan shapes in paintings on the walls of some tombs of high officials. Just as in the case of Punt, the Egyptians described the gifts from Keftiu as “tribute,” but Keftiu was an ally, not a vassal state. Minoan artists had decorated Canaanite palaces in the eighteenth and seventeenth centuries BCE, but this seems to have been their first work in Egypt. Under Thutmose III, Egypt was gradually becoming more involved with the outside world. Some of this involvement was military, but the presence of foreign wives and craftsmen signals a greater openness to foreign culture as well.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 149](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=174&annotation=P296FYZN))
