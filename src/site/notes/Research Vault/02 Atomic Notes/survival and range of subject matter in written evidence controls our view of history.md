“The breadth of written evidence also varies in terms of survival and range of subject matter. For example, the first Aegean scripts, unlike those to the east, were written principally on unfired clay tablets that only survived if a conflagration consumed the building containing them.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=30&annotation=BVI2RL9A))
