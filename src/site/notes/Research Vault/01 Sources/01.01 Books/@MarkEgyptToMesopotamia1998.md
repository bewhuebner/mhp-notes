### Dynasty 0 evidence connecting Buto and Mesopotamia

“The last period is the Naqada III, or Dynasty O (3200­-3100 B.C.). At the beginning, the new power of regional kings is seen in the appearance of true royal  cemeteries, as at Abydos, and possibly a trend in some areas toward the concentration of the populace around administrative centers, such as Hierakonpolis. The  period is best known for its carved ivory knife handles and large ceremonial slate palettes that bear both scenes of war and Mesopotamian motifs. It is a time of  transition that culminates with the rise of a true Egyptian state. It has been argued that Egypt was unified as early as the Naqada IIIa period under a King Scorpion.  This interpretation is based on a number of artifacts and royal symbols recovered from Tomb U­j at Abydos. These artifacts consist of an ivory scepter in the shape of  a crook, Palestinian pottery, and bone or ivory labels possibly attached to bolts of cloth, of which one was decorated with a palace­ facade motif. The evidence that  this early king ruled over a unified Egypt consists of a few bone labels that may be inscribed with the name of Buto or Bubastis. These labels may be evidence of  raiding or trade, but they hardly constitute evidence of a unified country.” ([Mark, 1998, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=30&annotation=3J44M9G3))

### depictions on non-indigenous animals reveal foreign contacts of pre-dynastic Egypt

### cylinder seals come to Egypt from Mesopotamia via Syria

“The evidence reviewed here suggests that such seals reached Egypt via northern Syria and the sea. In addition, the distribution of hemispheroid stamp seals found between northern Mesopotamia  and Susa is consistent with earlier evidence of trade between these two areas. The discovery of such a seal in Egypt and the absence of similar seals in Palestine also  suggest seals were transported to Egypt via northern Syria and the sea (fig. 27).” ([Mark, 1998, p. 51](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=60&annotation=RBSADBXM))

### boards used in coffins and tombs my be repurposed boat planks

“Frankfort responds by pointing out that the shapes of the planks and type of fastenings used to join them suggest that they are salvaged remains of one or  more Nile river vessels. A more recent study of these planks by Steve Vinson supports Frankfort's interpretation.” ([Mark, 1998, p. 59](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=68&annotation=NFEXE5TP))

### a summary of what architecture may signify for Mesopotamia-Egypt connection in prehistory

“Furthermore, lapis lazuli continued to be  imported through the beginning of the First Dynasty, and the appearance of these tombs also seems to coincide roughly with the appearance of monkey figurines in the  Grey Eye Temple at Tell Brak. Thus, crenelated tombs may be a further indication of continued contact between Egypt and Mesopotamia during early dynastic times.” ([Mark, 1998, p. 66](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=75&annotation=FPTF5BS6))

### bow v. stern of boats on the Gebel el-Arak knife

“In regard to vessels, Bruce Williams and Thomas Logan contend that Bénédite reversed the bow and stern of the two vessels in the third register, and cite as a parallel  a              boat relief on the handle of a knife in the Metropolitan Museum of Art that displays the same arrangement of a pole attached by three ties to one extremity of a vessel  (fig. 37). On this relief we see a man sitting with his back to this pole—and he is grasping a steering oar. As the steering oar is always located in the stern of a boat, the end of the boat on the Gebel el Arak knife at which Bénédite locates the "mast" should therefore be the stern.” ([Mark, 1998, p. 73](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=82&annotation=MZLX4KD6))

### stabilizing poles on reed boats in Egypt

“Therefore, pulling both ends of the vessel inward to form crescents and then tying them to a pole to hold them fast would have increased tension  throughout the boat and further tightened the lashings around the reed bundles. This would have resulted in a stronger and more stable craft.” ([Mark, 1998, p. 73](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=82&annotation=ISMKU8FY))

### Nile Delta city of Buto as the entrepot for shipbuilding to come from Mesopotamia to Egypt

“f we add to this the possibility that Buto in the Nile Delta served as an important Egyptian importer of Mesopotamian goods, and  at the same time adopted various Mesopotamian architectural features, it would be understandable that its people would also have learned some Mesopotamian ship  construction techniques and copied the motifs used to decorate watercraft. In fact, the vague similarities between the knife handle and the Hierakonpolis painting is the  only apparent connection between the Gebel el Arak knife and southern Egypt.” ([Mark, 1998, p. 77](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=86&annotation=B3EYYZVZ))

### Buto port and boat depictions on the Narmer Palette

“Above the decapitated bodies is carved a door, a bird, a boat, and a falcon. The "door" sign usually signifies a frontier post or stronghold that controls access into  Egypt. For example, a hieroglyph consisting of a door and a sedge refers to the southern frontier post of Elephantine or the "Door of the South". On the Narmer  palette, the door sign is translated as the ''Great Door" and the falcon is equated with the falcon­god Horus (i.e. Narmer), and the boat signifies the Harpoon nome.  This group of symbols has been interpreted to describe Narmer's taking of the Great Door (or Port?) of Buto because a port at Buto would control access to the sea. The king and his entourage therefore are proceeding through Buto to inspect the decapitated bodies of his enemy (fig. 49).” ([Mark, 1998, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=106&annotation=N87VPHR2))

“If the Narmer palette does indeed portray the unification of Egypt, then a few amendments make plausible a variation of the traditional interpretation that may explain  the flaws described above. This variation is predicated on the possibility that Buto was the main port through which Mesopotamian influences entered Egypt.” ([Mark, 1998, p. 104](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=113&annotation=YB6MZW4K))

“the earliest indication of Hathor comes from an ivory plaque dating to the reign of King Djer, which affiliates Hathor with Buto. This early  association with Buto may have resulted in her becoming protector of shipping to foreign parts. She is also identified with the mother goddess at Byblos, the patroness  of shipmasters. According to Bleeker, this relationship is due to early trading between Egypt and Syria.” ([Mark, 1998, p. 105](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=114&annotation=P674WFLP)) 
	
> Bleeker p. 72 - "Already in the 3rd milenium BC, Hathor was identified with the local Semitic goddess at Byblos. . . . The Ba'alat Gebal, mistress of Byblos, was identified, was the patroness  of the shipmasters. Hathor likewise protects shipping on the Nile, to foreign parts and in the sky."

“The Mesopotamian signs and motifs on the Narmer palette become much more understandable if we accept the possibility that the Delta was the entrepôt for  Mesopotamian goods during the Naqada II and III periods. If this interpretation of the Mesopotamian elements on the palette is valid, it then follows that northern  Mesopotamia continued to have a strong influence on Lower Egypt at least as late as the unification. The relevance of this sustained influence will be clarified in the next chapter.” ([Mark, 1998, p. 121](zotero://select/library/items/KAD9XH5N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV7SU7ME?page=130&annotation=ER3N4RZ2))
