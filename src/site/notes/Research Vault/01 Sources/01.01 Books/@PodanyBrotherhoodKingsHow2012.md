# Part II - The Old Babylonian Period – 2000–1595 BCE

## Chapter Three: War and Allegiance - “I have always done good things for him and his heart knows the good deeds that I have done for him”

“The Early Dynastic and Akkadian Empire kings seem to have been fascinated by lands beyond their own, making alliances, diplomatic marriages, treaties, trading relationships, and (especially in the cases of Sargon and Naram-Sin) conquests. The next great era of international contact was the Old Babylonian period, from around 2000 to 1595 BCE, when kings in Syria and Mesopotamia used the diplomatic system to promote their own interests and build up their own power. At the same time, traders began moving out into the areas from which valuable resources could be acquired, rather than waiting for the goods to come to them.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 63](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=88&annotation=4L9SDFDH))

“At about the same time that Hammurabi began to conquer lands to the north and south of Babylon, unifying Mesopotamia under his rule, Egypt experienced the opposite—it began suffering a decline that ended up with the land divided. One mace head found in Ebla seems to be from Egypt at this time, the Thirteenth Dynasty, providing a clue to some sort of contact with Syria. It bears a name in golden Egyptian hieroglyphs, Hotepibre, which is the name of an obscure Egyptian king. But scholars can’t agree on almost anything about this object; the more they study it, the less it seems to say.” ([Podany, 2012, p. 114](zotero://select/library/items/GN73GMNP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LXNK9GFK?page=139&annotation=D6BP6SVC))
