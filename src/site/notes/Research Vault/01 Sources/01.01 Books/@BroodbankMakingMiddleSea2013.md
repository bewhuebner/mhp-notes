## Dustjacket Summary

The Mediterranean has been for millennia one of the global cockpits of human endeavor. World-class interpretations exist of its Classical and subsequent history, but there has been remarkably little holistic exploration of how its societies, culture and economies first came into being, despite the fact that almost all the fundamental developments originated well before 500 BC. This book is the first full, interpretive synthesis for a generation on the rise of the Mediterranean world from its beginning, before the emergence of our own species, up to the threshold of Classical times, by which time the "Middle Sea" was already in effect made.  
  
Thanks to unrivaled depth and breadth of exploration, Mediterranean archaeology is one of the world's richest sources for the reconstruction of ancient societies. This book is the first to draw in equal measure on ideas and information from the European, western Asian and African flanks, as well as the islands at the Mediterranean's heart, to achieve a truly innovative focus on the varied trajectories and interactions that created this maritime world.  
  
The Mediterranean combines unusual conditions in a strictly unique fashion that goes a long way towards explaining its precocious development: it is the world's largest inland sea, easily the largest of the five challenging, opportunity-rich "mediterraneoid" environments on the planet, and adjacent to the riverine cores of two of the earliest civilizations, in Mesopotamia and Egypt. No wonder its societies proved exceptional.  
  
Extensively illustrated and ranging across disciplines, subject matter and chronology from early humans and the origins of farming and metallurgy to the rise of civilizations--Egyptian, Levantine, Hispanic, Minoan, Mycenaean, Phoenician, Etruscan, early Greek--the book is a masterpiece of archaeological and historical writing.

## Prickly leaves and brazen men

“The fundamental point is that the basic ways of living being forged in the European Mediterranean, which would underpin history there for a long time to come, evolved (unlike farming) in situ, and in patchy synchrony.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 313](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=290&annotation=IFIDBUQX))

## Lilliputian lords

“Being on the sea was vital for some, notably Troy on the Dardanelles (to which it was connected by a sheltered inlet, later an alluvial plain and eventually a battlefield in the imaginations of Homerically inspired visitors) and Manika on the north-south trunk route of the western Aegean. Once we enter the archipelago, seaward orientation becomes paramount and the fortunes of those islands that made it into mid-stream abundantly apparent. Cycladic communities with all-round maritime connectivity emerged at nodal points among the webs of short inter-island hops.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 322](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=299&annotation=DBT995UH))

# Chapter Eleven: De profundis

## The nature of early Mediterranean history

“In order to trace its rise with least danger of back-projecting its final properties onto the diverse, lively trajectories of earlier times, we have had to explore a multitude of streams, and trace their courses over time, as some headed elsewhere or ran dry, while others began to flow in parallel, converge and finally blend into a stronger current. This history has been primarily one of the Mediterranean’s people, but of necessity it became a natural history too, of the basin’s physical fabric, of water (falling, flowing, undulating, fresh and salt), of changing bestiaries and flora, and not least the impacts of climatic turbulence on all of these.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 593](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=551&annotation=3SAAKVLX))

## Acceleration towards the Middle Sea

“Indeed, if the Levant has been affirmed over the course of this book as a consistently interesting place in terms of what was cumulatively achievable within an extremely, if changeably, connected part of the Mediterranean, Iberia has proven how much could also be done in relative solitude.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 601](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=559&annotation=B45BVIF7))

“The ‘long’ 3rd millennium, which in so many ways laid the foundations of the Mediterranean as we know it, was a disaster for most of Mediterranean Africa, and therein lie the seeds of much that would eventually follow on this other, southern flank of the Middle Sea when Iron Age people from across the sea began to break in.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 601](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=559&annotation=7NV7AKZD))

“In the east, the decisive development was the incorporation, around the transition from the 3rd to 2nd millennia BCE, of Cyprus, southern coastal Anatolia and the Aegean into a wider east Mediterranean world. This tied in to pre-existent circuits in the central Mediterranean during the middle of the 2nd millennium. In turn, the upshot, once sailing ships went native (especially in Sardinia) was that while the east underwent a phase of drastic restructuring in the centuries around 1200 BCE, strong connections between the centre and west were forged for the first time. This series of extensive, overlapping networks across a sail-shrunk sea at last created the maritime preconditions necessary for regular pan-Mediterranean travel. ‘Phoenician’ trade, which hides a multiplicity of participants beyond Tyre and the central Levant, was the almost instantaneous result.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 602](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=560&annotation=6KYH34EV))

“But what was truly novel and transformative in the 2nd and earlier 1st millennia BCE was the low cost of bulk movement by sea, as sailing ships spread, which allowed vastly more goods and materials to circulate, and enabled a genuinely interactive market to emerge, characterized by fluctuating consumer demands, profits sufficient to more than offset the outlay and risk of long-range ventures, specialist production niches and import substitution.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 602-03](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=561&annotation=48DJ4YD9))

## The view from Salamis

“The attributes of the local epic hero Ajax echo fighting styles glorified in Mycenae’s shaft graves, while earlier pots on Aegina carried some of the first images of seaborne warriors in the basin. Recent excavations at Kanakia, the principal late 2nd-millennium BCE site on Salamis, have even discovered, along with a chunk of oxhide ingot, a fragment of scale armour stamped for Ramesses II, whether testimony to a roving fighter or passing scrap merchant.

The moral is not that Salamis was always at the centre of things; it was not, and its few hours of glory on the world stage contrast with the repeated salience of Aegina. It is rather that even the most spectacular events and processes seen in the later Mediterranean were embedded in practices whose deeper antiquity has too often gone unrecognized. lust like the musters of ships that converged at Salamis, the innumerable strands of early history that came together to create the Mediterranean had diverse origins of unequal significance, traced various approach routes, bunched and combined at different times, and need to be measured against others (hundreds of vessels in the case of the Persian fleet) that were driven elsewhere or otherwise lost before the great merging. When the Persian king Xerxes, enthroned above the battle, looked down on the melee of metal, wood and humanity, he was staring unknowingly through the defeat of a day, and deep into the Mediterranean’s past.” ([Broodbank, 2013, p. 610](zotero://select/library/items/IR54JIQG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/85K7BT2G?page=568&annotation=WSM4LDY7))
