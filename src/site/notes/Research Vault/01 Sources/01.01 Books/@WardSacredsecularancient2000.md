# I. INTRODUCTION

### Egyptian boat models and images are magical connections to divine boats

“Recent scholarship concerning the purpose of boat models and representations suggests that they served to connect magically the deceased with the godly attributes of the pharaoh or to make the gods aware of the virtues of the deceased. One scholar writes: "Nowhere in mortuary literature is it stated that the deceased is to provide any boat, solar or otherwise, for his journey. Indeed, he is always described as using the boats of divinities who already have access to the desired destination." The different boats present in Old Kingdom funerary texts and equipment may have acted as "passports" for the deceased by demonstrating his knowledge of the gods' secrets and thus reinforcing his qualifications to join them.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=12&annotation=28J3LDYM))

### even predynastic Egypt controlled the ship as a cultural symbol

“Williams traces the association of oared boats and pharaonic imagery back to aqada I or the beginning of Naqada ll, and sees a royal monopoly on ceremonial attributes of ships in predynastic and Early Dynastic ship representations. The sacred bark belonged exclusively to the gods, the pharaohs, and the dead, never serving ordinary purposes. Control over the ship as a cultural symbol, both as a concrete object and as a representation, suggests that the state already allocated resources preferentially and had access to materials and labor not available to the general population.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=13&annotation=EHVS3C9N))

### Nubian royal symbols were used before Egypt used them, suggesting interaction in predynastic times

“In ancient Egypt, symbolic watercraft, bulls, thrones, and kings depicted on objects dating to the wet phase of c. 3500 B.C. demonstrate a firmly established ideology. These same symbols appear early in Nubia as well, suggesting that interaction with Nubia may have influenced the very conceptualization of Egyptian society. According to Bruce Williams, Nubian artifacts imitate Egyptian Amratian/Naqada I styles, but during Naqada II and III, local materials and styles displace Egyptian features at Qustul, near the modern border between Egypt and Sudan. At Qustul, symbols of kingship such as the serekh (palace facade), falcon, feline deity, royal ship, throne, and the crown were used before their adoption in Egypt. Williams notes that it was only after Aha's Dynasty 1 Nubian campaign that Nubia began to follow Egypt's lead once more. Ward has pointed out that the Egyptian language demonstrates a mixture of Semitic-African influences with a Semitic "super-stratum" heavily overlaid with African traits.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=16&annotation=6IJC3LSX))

### early dynastic boat graves at Abydos show the ties between kingship and the sacred aspect of boats in Egypt

“At Abydos, Early Dynastic tombs demonstrate the large portion of resources devoted to the monuments and cults of the dead. Thousands of perfume-filled stone vases, elaborate jewelry, and other finely crafted objects were buried with each king. The funerary complex at Abydos also includes at least twelve boat graves, each more than 19 meters long, probably dating to Dynasty 1 or 2 (see Ch. 4). The sacred nature of the hulls and the importance of watercraft in the panoply of kingship and ritual are demonstrated by the lack of any secondary burials or buildings in the area until the Middle Kingdom. Even though burial at Abydos enhanced one's chances in the afterlife, a 1200-squre-meter area that included the boat graves was left inviolate for more than one thousand years.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=17&annotation=QWYJCBCJ))

### boat transportation was efficient and central to Egypt's governmental structure

“Boats transported goods and people so efficiently that Egypt had no significant roads until the Roman era. Naval officers, or at least persons with naval titles, held prominent positions in all areas of government. Work crews, whether working in the turquoise mines of the Sinai or transporting stone from Hatnub, split into SJ, or "gangs." Listed from greatest to least seniority, there were the forward-starboard (imy-wrt), forward-port (tJ-wr), aft-starboard (wJfit), aft-port (nd_st), and steerage, or rudder (jmj-nfrt), gangs. Each of these gangs was divided into two to four subgroups. This ordering of labor may even have , tended to the priesthood, although recent scholarship offers an alternative interpretation of evidence.' ([Ward, 2000, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=19&annotation=KM592IAM))

### Middle Kingdom Egypt monitored and recorded all aspects of ship construction for the state

“During Dynasty 12, the management of information and organization of labor had reached the point that a vizier in Memphis monitored every minor movement of planks, hides, and new and used tools in and out of a royal shipyard near Abydos, nearly 350 miles away. The scribe, already portrayed in shipbuilding scenes of the Old Kingdom, continued to play a major role in the daily operation of government shipyards.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=20&annotation=RWRZ352P))

### Egyptian sacred texts reveal their view of boats in practical terms and in mythical terms

“In addition, the OId Kingdom *Pyramid Texts* and Middle Kingdom *Coffin Texts* each contribute to a comprehensive study of ancient Egyptian watercraft. The Old Kingdom spells allude to thirty-two different types of boats, including celestial vessels sailed by the gods and the stars, earthly boats for the king, boats of divine justice and taxation, transport boats to bring food to the king in the other world, and funerary boats. One study of the boats in the Pyramid Texts focuses on identifying the different names of the boats with determinatives and shows that they are not all to be classed as solar boats.

Spells command a boat to be brought, and the deceased must name the different parts of the hull and compare them to godly images, such as the "ribs of Nephthys," or what seems to be a rope: "Take a *n'w* snake which is with the Controller of the Two Lands and put it in her [the hull], with its head in your hand and its hinder-part in my hand, and we must pull it tight between us in its name of Pain.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=22&annotation=DTV4YIHY))

# II. NATURAL RESOURCES

### most Egyptian boats used acacia wood for tenons

“Dockyard records of the early Middle Kingdom refer to the delivery of boatloads of "white" acacia timber. Its hardness was valued for manufacturing tenons; the Khufu vessel, the Lisht timbers, and the shrine of Tutankhamen include acacia tenons. Coffins from the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms had both tenons and pegs of acacia; furniture of all eras, predynastic logs and roots, Early Dynastic beams, and tree trunks of acacia are also known.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=25&annotation=PBV7P65U))

### cedar wood was preferred by Egypt for both practical and aesthetic reasons

“Killen suggests that although cedar can be knotty and has a very pronounced grain pattern, it was preferred by the Egyptians because its softness allowed their copper tools to be more effective. Egyptians also appreciated the fragrance and rot resistance of cedar and related these characteristics to religious concerns; durability is a prime practical concern for shipwrights.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=29&annotation=BKQGMQMF))

### obtaining cedar was costly and the supply varied as Egypt's fortunes varied

“Mikesell points out that when Egypt was a powerful, tribute-demanding state (as in the Old Kingdom, Dynasty 12, and Dynasty 18), huge amounts of cedar were cut for the Egyptians and sent to Egypt, but that in Dynasty 21, Wenamun experienced great difficulties getting lumber for the ceremonial ship of Amun-Re. Wenamun obtained seven logs, but then had to provide jars of gold and silver, rolls of linen and papyrus, cowhides, ropes, lentils, and fish before the Syrian prince arranged for three hundred men and oxen to cut and haul the remaining timber.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=31&annotation=L97NTILV))

### Egypt may have more timber available than some scholars suggest

“Timber resources in Egypt were probably greater than has been suggested in the past, particularly if the use and abundance of acacia, sycamore, and tamarisk are considered. Foreign timber was available but extremely expensive. Both local and foreign timber resources were under royal control, although trade on an individual level also occurred. The use of so many different imported woods and the quantities of wood imported imply that the Egyptians were economically powerful.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=33&annotation=5GJWNHPU))

# III. TOOLS AND WOODWORKING

### markings left on planks and ship parts show the process of Egyptian shipbuilding

“Shipwrights marked plank joins and mortises on the Lisht and Dashur hulls with score marks and black painted lines (see Chs. 8 and 10). The most extensive series of marks has been found on the Khufu I ship, but most of the hull signs probably were associated with its anticipated reassembly rather than with its original construction. The clearly marked centerline on the Khufu I vessel is the exception; it probably was used to check hull symmetry.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 29](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=39&annotation=UYWUVXX2))

### the Egyptian word for boat-building means 

#USE

“Twisted fibers bound the earliest papyrus rafts together, and the use of cordage played a dominant role in ancient Egyptian ship construction. The most common word for boatbuilding, spt, means "to sew."” ([Ward, 2000, p. 29](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=39&annotation=HAILSJSA))

### the effort and technology for woodworking shows the status and cost associated with Egyptian ships

“Boards of regular thickness in predynastic coffins provide us with the first physical evidence of woodworking skills, but their thinness suggests considerable experience had already been accumulated. Because the graves with the most wood also contained the greatest number of artifacts, we can view the inclusion of worked wood as another indication of status and rank, foreshadowing the domination of material resource by the state in later times. By the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period, woodworkers had developed a number of fastening techniques, probably facilitated by the use of metal tools, that became standard in the repertoire of both carpentry and shipbuilding. Tarkhan coffins and planks from graves document these traditions and furnish valuable tools for thinking about ways early Egyptian hulls could have utilized existing woodworking technology.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=47&annotation=7TKVLCQ2))

# IV. EARLY DYNASTIC HULLS AT ABYDOS

### summary of the boat graves at Abydos

“More than 4,700 years ago, at least 12 boats were moored for eternity in the desert sands at Abydos, more than 11 kilometers from the Nile river. Entombed in mud-brick, boat-shaped graves, the hulls lay forgotten outside the funerary monuments of Egypt's earliest historic kings until late 1991, when a University of Pennsylvania-Yale Expedition to Abydos excavation team under the direction of Dr. David O'Connor uncovered this Early Dynastic fleet-the most ancient planked hulls in the world. 

The fleet at Abydos more than doubles the number of known Egyptian hulls, bringing the total of extant hulls to 20. Although more than 20 funerary sites in Egypt incorporated boat burials, there are twice as many boat graves at Abydos than at any other site. Before the Abydos find, Early Dynastic boat graves and hulls had been excavated at Saqqara, but little is known about the actual boats from mud-brick graves there. Sixteen model boats buried in a row east of the small Dynasty 6 pyramid of Queen Neit, also at Saqqara, provide the only parallel for such a large number of buried watercraft. Like the Abydos hulls buried nearly a millennium earlier, the Neit models are aligned on an east-west axis, but their burial represented only a fraction of the social and economic investment represented by entombed boats.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 38](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=48&annotation=ZRFU4NYZ))

“Trenches 10-25 centimeters deep were cut into bedrock and coated with mud plaster. After setting the boats into the plaster, workers built gently curving mud-brick walls about 30 centimeters thick and 50 centimeters high around each hull, coated the walls with mud plaster, and then whitewashed the entire structure. Weathering on the windward side of the graves suggests that the graves had been exposed for a long time.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=50&annotation=IW8VSGC2))

“Boat images in this and earlier periods often have either shrines or a throne centrally located; a seal inscribed with "The Ships of the King" includes three ships with large, centrally positioned thrones like that on the Qustul incense burner (Figs. 136 and 1 ).” ([Ward, 2000, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=50&annotation=4BA98HT9))

### In Egypt, one early boat model exists, but they disappear during the early dynastic period

“A clay model dating to about 4000 B.C from Merimde Beni Salaam provides the most ancient evid n for watercraft in Egypt, and by Naqada ll, the custom of burying boat models in graves had b en established. 12 After Dynasty 1, boat models, but not watercraft, disappear from burials until late Dynasty 5, when a few models are reported, and Dynasty 6, when large groups of wooden models portraying different vessel types were buried with royalty and high ranking nobility.13 Dynasty 6 and later Middle and New Kingdom models are useful for studying rigging, decoration, and construction features at deck level, but only rarely do they offer information about internal construction. 14” ([Ward, 2000, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=51&annotation=EZQYCZNF))

### Egypt's Abydos boat graves show ties to the Levant and imported cedar wood

“The Abydos hulls may also affect discussions about early links between Egypt and the Near East. Tombs at Abydos containing North Syrian pottery and beams and planks that Petrie identified as conifers suggest Egyptian contact with the Levantine coast. University of Pennsylvania excavators at Abydos believe the reddish wood of Boat 10 is also from a conifer and report that it was aromatic when brushed.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 42](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=52&annotation=G3R2HDMR))

“Thus, the fleet required at least 14,400 kilograms of finished timber to build. Even if the wood used was a locally available acacia or tamarisk, the amount of work involved in the manufacture and joining of planks is comparable to building an elaborate tomb or even one of the massive funerary enclosures looming over the boat graves today. If the boats were built of imported wood such as cedar and juniper, they provide the earliest and strongest testimony to date for direct seaborne Egyptian contact with the Levant.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 42](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=52&annotation=4TIJ7SYC))

# V. KHUFU I: A ROYAL SHIP

“Just as stone architecture of the Old Kingdom translat- ed wood and brick buildings into huge symbols that reflected the king's power, so the Khufu I hull transformed a simple means of transporta- tion into a massive ship of state. Its function re- mains obscure; some see it as a solar boat with :ittong religious connotations while others view it as a funerary pi! rima e vessel” ([Ward, 2000, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=53&annotation=2U6PNBUV))

“el Mallakh, the archaeologist who discovered the pits, made a hole in the twenty-second eastern block and saw a steering oar, boards, columns, beams, apd remains of matting and ropes, all ex- tremely well preserved. The forward papyri- form finial showed that the bow of the disman- tled ship pointed west.'” ([Ward, 2000, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=53&annotation=MBMEK6RC))

“Shell-built with planks carved from logs at least 7 meters long, the Khu- fu I ship represents a tremendous investment of labor and capital. Its builders cut several thou- sand V-shaped channels in rows across the in- side of the hull and threaded more than a mile of rope in and out of the holes. On deck, a col- lapsible deckhouse and canopy constructed from prefabricated cedar panels provided shel- ter from the elements.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=54&annotation=7TBV76DU)) Khufu ship uses over one mile of rope to lash planks together

 ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=55&annotation=BYU9M8DB)) ([Ward, 2000, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6))

“Six hundred fifty-one major pieces and an additional 467 tenons in the hull and 200 tenons in the cabin were counted. The 651 major pieces included 30 planks, 16 floor timbers, 62 deck beams, 36 stanchions, a carling and 2 stringers, 22 sections of decking, 23 pre- fabricated deckhouse panels, 58 papyrus-bud pillars, 5 doors, and 300 battens. Baskets of un- used rope, lashings, and other cordage were al- so retrieved. When reconstructed, the hull mea- sured 42.3 x 5.66 x 1.8 meters. 4” ([Ward, 2000, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=55&annotation=PBKBTJPQ))

“Plank edges in watercraft from other places and times are typically straight; Khufu planking edges feature joggles that locked the edges of adjacent planks together as shown in Figure 17. The projecting joggles incline in alter- nate directions, decreasing longitudinal move- ment. Long planks tend to bend and hog; jog- gled edges resisted both hogging and bending by reducing the relative movement between planks. In addition, transverse lashing inside the hull spread any deformation across the en- tire vessel, reducing the stress on any particular joint. The use of joggled plank edges is critical to understanding how Egyptian ships could with- stand the tremendous forces imparted by the transport of massive stone objects or stresses created by waves at sea.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 48](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=56&annotation=FH3NYWQA))

“The overwhelming impression gained from studying the Khufu I hull is that shipwrights left the wood in the hull bottom alone as much as possible. Their experience may have taught them that increasing the number of fastenings there increased potential sources for leaks or that seating the first strake on top of the bottom planking and then rabbeting the midships area made use of the hull's weight and geometry and was sufficient to keep it together. Mortise-and- tenon fastenings in transverse lines and the transverse lashings of the hull played important roles in the finished vessel. Using these tech- niques minimized the need to put holes in or otherwise weaken the bottom planking. The hull's shape, construction, and fastening sys- tems appear to hold the bottom together in ways both daring and foreign to modern boat- building and naval architectural standards.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 52](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=60&annotation=34FLBP5Q))

## How TO BUILD A ROYAL SHIP #USE

“Because the high ends and upright finials of Khufu l resemble those of papyrus boats, it is called ;- papyriform vessel, a ceremonial type that reflects the origins of Egyptian hull con- struction. Representations of papyriform hulls are usually ritualistic in nature. Papyriform boats are used for pilgrimages to sacred sites, for symbolically charged hippopotamus hunts, and b the gods, particularly the sun god Re for his-travels across the sky in the m 'nd_t (day) and msktt (night) boats. When Khufu I and the neighboring sealed boat pit were discovered, scholars began a debate about its purpose that continues more than forty years later.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=66&annotation=H2ACVC2T))

“An alternate point of view is offered by CernY£._ who suggests that Khufu I was not a so- lar bar ue, but a funerary boat for carrying the ~y of the_king to Giza while the four other boats were intended to ceremonially transport him to the four cardinal directions.' 9 Thomas agreed with Cerny that the Khufu I was not so- lar in nature because of its ~ ten propulsion oars” ([Ward, 2000, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=66&annotation=WEBC3SC2))

“Amon other arguments, Abubakr and • o tafa appropriately point out that the lightly later Pyramid Texts do not mandate a so- lar boat for the king, that the Khufu ship has a different form than most solar boats, and that none of the symbolic elements of solar boats were found with the Khufu I huJl.52 The Khufu ship, in their opinion, exhibits none of the at- tributes of solar watercraft as enumerated by Se- lim Hassan.-" Hawass rebuts this last argument by pointing out that reed mats and flint tools can be considered solar symbols, and the mat- ting and single flint knife from the Khufu I pit disproves the idea that the Khufu hull lacks a connection with solar boats. 54 Whether or not the flint knife and matting are solar symbols, none of the other typical features of solar boats such as thrones, feathers, hawks and vaulted cabins were present. ·ew of this, it is unlike- ly that Khufu I can be identified as a so_illr boat.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 59](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=67&annotation=ENI7Y5U7))

# VI. KHUFU II: THE UNEXCAVATED SISTER SHIP

“Because the planks from the first excavated boat pit were in such excellent condition, many people were surprised at Khufu II's rather decayed appearance.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 61](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=69&annotation=IQFJRZT8))

“This suggests that we were extraordinarily lucky to have recovered one vessel in such excellent condition and that the condition of Khufu II may be influenced by other factors.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 62](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=70&annotation=UWV4MQPR))

“The luxury of comparing two such large and stately vessels, built more than 4,500 years ago, is not often granted to archaeologists. The nondestructive documentation of the unexcavated boat pit beside Khufu's pyramid provided a wealth of information. The Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt is considering allowing excavation of the now-closed pit; while such an excavation offers much to scientists, the problems of conservation and curating are immense. If excavation is permitted, a truly innovative display could be created by documenting, conserving, and replacing timbers rather than mounting a full-scale reconstruction of a poorly preserved ship. Imagine walking down into the pit, cut so many millennia ago into the limestone plateau, and seeing labeled drawings showing where hull parts, stored in climate-controlled showcases, originally fit on the ship. Then, visitors could walk into the existing museum where the beautifully reconstructed Khufu I continues to amaze all who see it.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 68](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=76&annotation=ZCY3CNAX))

# VII. IMMORTAL STRUCTURES: ROCK-CUT AND BRICK BOATS OF THE OLD KINGDOM

“In Egyptian religious practices of the Old Kingdom documented by the Pyramid Texts, names for 32 different boats used by Re, the king, and the gods in proper religious funerals and the afterlife indicate the importance of watercraft in mortuary ritual. The dead king boards the "great boat" and sails to the horizon with Re or travels with Re in another boat where, in Re's stead, he commands the crew and gives orders to the gods.' Although the names for the various boats are known and some representations include captions that tell us what type of craft is represented, making a connection between watercraft buried in mortuary complexes and religious literature has proved difficult.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 69](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=77&annotation=WRIMV47K))

“The most unusual ancient Egyptian hulls may be the rock-cut boats of Khafra (c. 2500 B.c.). The pyramid complex of Khafra lies west of Khufu's, and it includes at least four subterranean boat-shaped cuttings in the rock plateau,” ([Ward, 2000, p. 69](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=77&annotation=NLL2LMMR))

“excavated by Selim Hassan in 1934 (Fig. 24).2 Straight-sided trenches 1.0 or 1.1 meters wide descend into the limestone plateau where the hulls and other features are carved out of the rock. If a substance such as plaster or epoxy resin were poured into the rock-cut boats and the surrounding rock chipped away, a solid model of a vessel more than 20 meters long would remain. A pair of boats is aligned on an east-west axis on each side of the causeway leading to the mortuary temple; a possibly rectangular pit and another unfinished pit run along a north-south axis nearby.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 70](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=78&annotation=H47EG4JR))

“he rock-cut boats of Khafra represent hulls that, had they been made of wood, could have travelled on the Nile. The hull shapes and such fittings as are represented are in accord with a long tradition of shipbuilding that stretches as far back as the Early Dynastic boats from Abydos. Khafra Boats 1-4 exhibit lines similar to those of ancient Egyptian wooden hulls and boat models. They are 40-47 cubits long, 7 or 10 cubits wide, and 3 cubits deep. Floor timber proportions and placement are remarkably similar to the system used to place deckbeams in the Khufu I hull. If we knew more about the floor timbers of that hull, we might find the Khafra pattern reflected even more closely.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 76](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=84&annotation=NP749S2U))

“With the exception of the uneven and poorly defined floor timbers of Boat 2, the Khafra hulls reflect Old Kingdom hull construction as we know it from the Khufu hulls. Identical cabin heights in Boats 1 and 3 and Khufu I suggest standardization of size. The conformity of the Khafra boats to principles evident in the Khufu vessels suggests that a master shipwright supervised the masons who cut the boats.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 76](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=84&annotation=JHETREFW))

“Modern u e of reed floats may provide xplanations for the emphasis on duality in referen es to reed watercraft. Nubians at the second cataract us d a "huge wedge-shaped bundle of reeds" about four meters long, made of two conical bundles of reeds lashed together to cross the ile. Breasted links modern reed floats to the ancient s[mwy, from the word for "to embrace" or "armful," represented by pairs of elongated O\~alsand among the oldest symbols in the Pyramzd Texts.He cites Utterance 337a "the two sh11 of the sky are laid for Re, that 1 he may ferry across to the horizon therewith." The dead king also traveled on the two sl].nof the sky. Breasted believes that the practical basis of the actual double reed float explained the constant duality of its determinative. 18” ([Ward, 2000, p. 78](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=86&annotation=29XGK28T))

“In the PyramidTexts,reed floats are used for short journeys, such as from earth to heaven or across flooded celestial fields. Their construction was unsuited to the much longer journeys later Egyptians believed were made by solar boats. Once in heaven, the king met four spirits from the east, sometimes identified as divine shipwrights or sons of Horus, a god associated with the east. In Utterance 519, four young people tie reed floats together to make a solar boat, presumably for that day's use. The oldest PyramidTextsare those of the Dynasty 5 ruler Unas. Solar identifications of Unas with Re are strong, but links with earlier rulers are not as clear. Although the solar cult declined rapidly after Unas, and Re is not mentioned in the PyramidTextsof later rulers, solar boats, and the transport of reed floats in solar boats, con-” ([Ward, 2000, p. 78](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=86&annotation=CWTMECE7))

“tinued to play a major role in the conception of the afterlife. Hassan suggests that because the duality of the reed float was theologically important, wooden solar boats, which did not need to be double, came to be seen as Day and Night boats, "thus retaining their duality and at the same time assigning a logical reason for it."20 An emphasis on duality can be seen in the disposition of both Old and Middle Kingdom watercraft in mortuary settings. The wooden Khufu hulls seem to be a pair, and models of funerary boats often occur in pairs yet five (or more) boats also are reported. At Saqqara, the discovery of a pair of boats prompted this comment: '1n the filling on the north side of a ma taba of the Sixth Dynasty were found two solarbarques, the timbers of which were fastened together with ropes." 21 No other details, including the basis for identifying the pair as solar, are provided, and the boats are unpublished. A pair of long and narrow limestone structures with tapered ends above the mastaba of Kagemni at Saqqara was identified as a pair of solar boats (Fig. 30),22 and excavations beside the Dynasty 6 pyramid of Raneferef recently revealed two 3meter-long wooden boats. 23 These examples from the late Old Kingdom point to ritualized belief in the symbolic importance of paired essels, but without sufficient information on hull types and disposition, determining their original purpose is difficult.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 78](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=86&annotation=HCTAZ6AI))

“Three rock-cut boats are known from the Khufu pyramid complex and two from between two subsidiary pyramids nearby.31 Like the pits on the south side of the pyramid, the stone boats are hewn out of the limestone of the plateau. The presence and shape of wood fragments in the bottom of the rock-cut boats suggest that they once held complete wooden vessels (Figs. 32-34). Steps leading into one of the hulls and the breadth of Khufu's rock-cut boats indicate that they were open to the sky but below ground level.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 80](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=88&annotation=AEQNKDIY))

“Zahi Hawass has studied the boats in the Khufu complex. He believes that Khufu Boats 3 and 4, on a north-south axis parallel to the east side of the pyramid on each side of the funerary temple, were the mil-boat and the g_3f-barkof Horus, the sky god, for taking the king to the horizon of Re. Khufu I and II from south of the pyramid are seen as msktt (night) and m 'ng_t (day) solar boats. The east-west boat north of the causeway is viewed as the funerary boat for transporting the mummy to Giza,34 or as possibly connected with the cult of Hathor, wife of the sun god Re and mother to the king.35 1fHawass is correct, the Khufu boats offer a very different perspective on the creation of rock-cut boats and the burial of hull than that provided for the Khafra, Una , Ka emni, Dynasty 6, and e-user-re boat . It i difficult, however, to link the single or paired e, amples of demonstrably solar boats and the lar e groups of Khufu and Khafra. Khufu I i m t similar to Khafra's Boat 1; Khufu II and Khafra Boat 3 may also be closely related. Khufu Boat and Khafra Boat 4 may also represent the same boat type, if the rounded cut-outs in Khufu were for stringers above the sheer trake.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 81](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=89&annotation=QIPWT8HG))

# VIII. THE DASHUR BOATS

“The largest collection of excavated Egyptian water raft comes from the Middle Kingdom pyramid of Senwosret III at Dashur. Five, or six, wooden boats were uncovered there during a search for an underground entrance to the pyra- mid by Jacques de Morgan in 1894. De Morgan reported finding three boats, each about 10 me- ters long, beside a large brick chamber, probably a boat grave, and three other boats about 100 meters south of the first group.' Subsequent maps of the pyramid complex illustrate only three or five boats, however, and only three boats can definitely be traced to de Morgan's ex- cavations.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 83](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=91&annotation=T49XWRYY))

“Radiocarbon dating on deck planks from the Field Museum vessel produced an average date of 1949 ± 47 B.C. and the Carnegie hull was dated to 1830 ± 170 B.C.4” ([Ward, 2000, p. 83](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=91&annotation=3GNWZ5QH))

“Unlike the Khufu boats, no one has tried to prove that the Dashur boats should be consid- ered as solar boats, and most scholars consider them to be associated with the funeral or burial of the king. No inscriptions or other artifacts from the excavation prove or disprove the rela- tionship with Senwosret III, although popular accounts of the Carnegie boat associate it with a "master of royal watercraft." 5 A basket filled with crude miniature ceramic containers is dis- played with the Chicago hull, but there is no sol- id evidence linking the basket with the excava- tion of the boats.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 83](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=91&annotation=K7KBQN7B))

“Each boat exhibits about the same rounded shape and curvature with a slightly flattened midsection. In each example, the stern is slight- ly higher than the bow, and the boats are some- what fuller aft of amidships (Fig. 35). Planks were built up around a thicker central strake, creating a planking shell. Deep mortise-and- tenon fastenings join thick planks worked into symmetrical strakes, and a second type of inter- nal fastening across plank seams is also present (Fig. 36). Modern reconstruction of the vessels has obscured most of the evidence showing that the mortises filled by dovetail tenons were once ligatures (see Fastenings, below).” ([Ward, 2000, p. 84](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=92&annotation=LZWCN844))

“White plaster and traces of red, blue, and black stripes remain on the outer hull of each of the Dashur boats. The once-lovely painted wd,;at-eyes, rosettes, and stylized lotus leaves on the steering oars of EM 4925 and EM 4926 have faded, leaving a negative impression on the wood's surface, and only a little red paint re- mains on stanchions described as having green and red stripes. 30 A small patch of red paint on the outside of Carnegie plank S2-3 suggests that its lower hull may have been painted red; green paint over plaster imbedded in adze marks on the outer surface of the after plank in the central strake of EM 4925 is difficult to reconci” ([Ward, 2000, p. 96](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=104&annotation=H6AE997Q))

“Their shape and decoration suggest that they were funerary boats, intended to be towed by other vessels. Garstang noted that each of eleven Middle Kingdom burials of minor offi- cials at Beni Hasan included a model of a row- ing and a sailing boat, and a granary. 37 The idea of two boats inte d • burial can be linked to Khufu I and II and to the Lisht models out- side the mastaba tomb of lmhotep. Their impor- tance to the dead person was on a par with the provision of grain-the staple food of ancient Egypt. Other excavations of Dynasty 12 tombs also included two or three model boats: two fu- nerary craft and one boat with solar symbols. 38 Middle Kingdom models of funerary boats are often painted green or yellow, have striped bulwarks and two steering oars like the Dashur hulls, and have the same 4:1 proportions. Mod- els have often been dismissed as inaccurately re- flecting the vessels they mimic, but if propor- tions are checked, cargo and travelling boats are 37. Garstang 1904:215-28, esp. p. 224. 38. Daressy 1900:17-43. about 3:1, war or racing hulls are much longer and narrower, and funerary boats are 4:1.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 101](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=109&annotation=PNILIVHE))

“The Dashur boats are clear descendants of the Khufu ships. As in Khufu I, the central strake in each of the Dashur boats was built of three sections. This strake depended completely on harnessing physical forces of compression to keep its planks properly aligned;” ([Ward, 2000, p. 101](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=109&annotation=7ZSQA8HW))

“The Dashur boats demonstrate thousands of years of expertise in ship construction. Even in the powerful Middle Kingdom, the use of at least six, and probably ten or more, tons of wood to build six cedar boats required tremen- dous expenditures of labor and capital. Burying these craft south of the pyramid of Senwosret III enhanced the prestige and standing of their owner or owners in the afterworld and in the ritualized world of the mortuary cult. Their con- struction reflects their ceremonial nature and importance as well as demonstrating technolog- ical continuity and change from the earliest ves- sels.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 102](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=110&annotation=A552WSAE))

“The burial of two solar boat models with very different equipment within the same funerary complex suggests that the funerary boat and solar boat existed as separate conceptual entities in Egyptian funerary practice. If the solar and funerary models were seen this way, and Middle Kingdom burial practices reflect Old Kingdom traditions, Khufu I cannot be a solar boat and must instead be a funerary craft ( ee Ch. 5). The planked model boat from Lisht is valuable to ship scholars not only for its unusual method of construction, but because it shows that there was an accepted norm for the construction of ceremonial vessels in the Middle Kingdom. The size of the 1.95-meter-Iong Lisht model, buried near the mastaba of a high priest, supports the interpretation of the later interment of six, 10-meter-long, cedar hulls as a kingly display of wealth and power at Dashur.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 106](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=114&annotation=KWFRBA2Y))

# X. WORKING BOATS: THE LISHT TIMBERS

“Forty timbers found during recent Metropolitan Museum of Art excavations at Lisht, and more than fifty timbers from much earlier excavations, can be identified as parts of watercraft, broken apart and used as foundations for roadways and ramps around the early Dynasty 12 pyramid of Senwosret I (c. 1950 B.C.). 1 Planks, a frame, and other transverse timbers sculpted from locally available woods demonstrate a previously unknown manner of hull construction using plaited lashing, intricate scarfing of timbers, and deep mortise-and-tenon joints.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 107](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=115&annotation=9CBIKEPB))

“their thrifty reuse as components of ramps and causeways shows that the Egyptians saw them as utilitarian, not ritual, in nature. 2 This attitude reflects the original function of the Lisht timbers as planks in freight boats. Intricately joggled edges, planks more than half as thick as broad, and fastening types and patterns suggest that the timbers b longed to a sturdy freight vessel. Freighters carried stone from the granite quarrie at A wan to Helwan in Early Dynastic times, and shipbuilders learned early to cope with the problems of stress from heavy loads. As Dieter Arnold has pointed out, a single tone block 1 x 1 x 2 meters weighs about five tons;' the elaborate building programs of the ancient Egyptians required efficient freighters. Boats with thick, intricately shaped and interlocking planks, deep mortise-and-tenon fastenings, and lashing fulfilled those requirements.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 107](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=115&annotation=6E2P4YB5)) #USE in 011

“joints in Mediterranean shipbuilding techniques fought lateral and longitudinal slippage; the Egyptian shipwrights knew the benefits of pegs but chose not to use them. No pegs perpendicular to tenons have been recorded from ancient Egyptian watercraft, with the exception of the repair to Lisht plank A-9, but Egyptian carpenters used this type of fastening frequently. Sarcophagi, furniture, and a sledge found with the Dashur boats all have perpendicularly pegged mortise-and-tenon joints. Even the cabin on the Khufu ship used such pegs.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 115](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=123&annotation=7ZKMW47K))

The Herodotus passage, often applied to any Egyptian ship from any period, has been interpreted as saying that the Egyptians caulk the seams of their vessels from within with papyrus. No trace of caulking has been found in any ancient Egyptian hull, however, and we have no evidence for the practice. Caulking is not used in shell-built watercraft anywhere. When the passage is evaluated from both lexicographical and ship construction viewpoints, it is clear that Herodotus could have been describing plank seams bound or fastened from within by papyrus, a practice which corresponds to the use of lashing in the Lisht timbers. 17 In addition to providing ship scholars with a new form of construction, the Lisht timbers are the first remains of what was probably a working boat to be studied. Both the Khufu and the Dashur vessels are from ceremonial contexts, and they reflect a different branch of Egyptian nautical technology that was unconcerned with "commercial freight." The technology used to combat strain and stress caused by the transport of great weights may be similar to that used in the construction of seagoing vessels, another point of contention among ship scholars. At the very least, studying the Lisht timbers informs us about what was possible for ancient Egyptian shipwrights.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 124](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=132&annotation=995P9R4K))

“Tcchniqu s used to build the Lisht vessel(s) als would have rv d the builders of Hath p, ut's barge for carrying two obelisks. A rec nt 1aluation of the different reconstructions of th barge focuses on whether it is possible to build a barge like that of Hatshepsut according to what is known about ancient Egyptian hull con truction in order to transport the Colossi of Menmon (c. 720 tons each). 19 Through computer programs, the authors tested the characteristics of two barges, 58 x 5.6 x 20 meters and 70 x 24 x 6 meters, built like Khufu I of cedar planks only 13 centimeters thick. They point out that acacia planks would have provided an even stronger hull and on lud thM th olo si of M mn n Ol Id a ily have been transp rt cl on c;uch a bnrg .10 In oth r words, a hull built more lightly than an anci nt Egyptian shipwright would build it theoretically could carry 1440 tons.

# XI. THE LATE PERIOD BOAT AT MATARIA, CAIRO: BREAKING WITH TRADITION

“The boat from Mataria is the latest known Egyptian hull, built some 1,400 years after the Dashur boats. Its builders lived in a prosperous, yet unstable, time and probably were ruled by the Persian Empire (525-404 B.C.). A Greek colony at Naucratis in the Delta dates to the sixth century B.C., and the Late Period saw increasing numbers of foreign residents in Egypt, providing the opportunity for Egyptians to observe different technological practices. The Mataria hull reflects Egyptian nautical traditions that incorporated a feature of Mediterranean shipbuilding found in ships dating from the late Bronze Age to the Byzantine period.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 133](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=141&annotation=B585Z8UD))

“The Mataria hull provides the only evidence for the use of pegged mortise-and-tenon fastenings in Egyptian hull construction, although the fastening was known and used in the manufacture of furniture, coffins, and statues from the time of the First Dynasty. The large tenons continue an an ient tradition; the pegs might reflect hipbuilding techniques adopted by the Egyptians in the late New Kingdom (c. 1250 B.C.). We must distinguish, however, between the Mediterranean practice of locking every joint in place with pegs on either side of a plank seam and the Egyptian practice of using pegs, or treenails, in some joints.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 134](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=142&annotation=KE4UDPCQ))

# XII. BUILDING BOATS AND SHIPS IN ANCIENT EGYPT

“l3y the lat r Old Kingdon,, an autobiographi al inscription brngs of building a 30-meter-long freighter in only seventeen day , a feat that d monstrates not only the sp d with which large hulls could be built, but the king's power to ommand the resources and laborers necessary to do it.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 137](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=145&annotation=FKMNBMLT))

“As the state's power increased during the Early Dynastic Period, it also increased its visible manifestations through building monumental structures. Narrow, fast vessels like those buried at Abydos were not intended to transport heavy loads, but ebony tablets from Early Dynastic tombs at Abydos feature large, rounded cargo carriers that could have moved grain, laborers, or even building materials. 2 The slender Abydos vessels are yet another expression of state wealth and power made physical; the carriers met practical demands for transporting the huge stones needed to erect monumental structures or the food to sustain workers and were themselves revolutionary feats of engineering. One technical demand drove another, and the craftsmen of Egypt quickly developed sophisticated solutions to problems of water transport. Water transport allowed the builders of the Early Dynastic temple at Hierakonpolis to incorporate granite from Aswan and facilitated the construction of an entire temple of stone by Khasekemwy (Dynasty 2).3” ([Ward, 2000, p. 137](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=145&annotation=6REUTJTZ))

“Models, texts, and representations testify to many different kinds of Egyptian watercraft, but excavated Egyptian watercraft provide evidence for only two branches of hull construction: sturdy, durable cargo carriers and elegant ceremonial hulls. Cargo carriers, exemplified by the Lisht timbers and the Mataria boat, were broad and shallow hulls designed to transport heavy goods. In contrast, the ceremonial Abydos, Khufu, and Dashur vessels were intended to carry people (or gods) and perhaps funeral equipment, so they were more lightly built and proportionally narrower. Despite these differences, the two hull types shared many design features. Thick planks with joggled edges, fastened by a combination of mortise-and-tenon joints and ligatures or lashing, created shallow vessels, built up plank by plank around a central section.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 137](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=145&annotation=EX2WTYRH))

“The expense of worked wood, particularly that of large planks used in building watercraft, was a driving force in the development of Egyptian nautical technology. For ceremonial vessels, raw materials were an even greater expense, because imported conifer timber from Syria was so highly prized. References to wood from older, broken-up hulls in dockyards make it clear that wood was stored for reuse in other watercraft. Some planks in the Cairo Dashur boats were used once before, and a beam from the Carnegie Dashur boat is so much older than” ([Ward, 2000, p. 138](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=146&annotation=LYNLPZE7))

“Similarities between planks at a single omplex ould be explained by the reuse of timbers from. a single massive freighter, but the r petitive vocabulary of shapes across four sites and 150 years illuminates part of the great web of Egyptian bureaucracy. Scribes in the shipyard monitored every scrap of wood and sharpened metal tool; a society so obsessed with bookkeeping and balancing accounts logically would plan ahead for the day when a vessel's planks were no longer fit for service in a hull but could meet other needs of the state.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 139](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=147&annotation=8SK5EDBN))

“Reuse of limb rs and standardized shap s w re not the only issue that influen ed construction m thods. Egyptian hulls se m pecifially d signed to allow di assembly. Khufu I provides the finest, and least controversial, example of this practice. Hieroglyphs on battens covering plank earns in the Khufu ship match those on planks where the battens fit, suggesting step-by-step instructions. Unlike sewn hulls elsewhere in the world, the Khufu vessels relied on transverse lashing across plank surfaces rather than lashing along plank seams. Ropes used for the transverse lashing passed freely in and out of V-shaped channels; ropes threaded through drilled holes along plank seams required pegging at each drilled hole to prevent longitudinal slippage. 6 Hulls with transverse lashing could be quickly reassembled with about one-fifth the cordage required for similar-sized hulls with lashing along longitudinal seams.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 139](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=147&annotation=M9SGGAUS))

“The classical author Diodorus and an early- nineteenth-century traveler in Egypt record the Egyptian practice of building ships, taking them apart, transporting them across land, and reassembling them where they were needed. 8” ([Ward, 2000, p. 139](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=147&annotation=7272RM39)) (see Diodorus Book II, 16)

“Obsidian has proved to be a g~od indicator of trade with Arabia and the African coast; Egypt became part of a network that linked East Africa, Arabia, the Indian subcontinent, and Mesopotamia during the predynastic period. 11 Naqada, Hierakonpolis, and Abydos controlled access to the routes across the Eastern Desert, and probably held near monopolies on the ships that traversed the Red Sea. Power associated with the redistribution of imported goods such as obsidian, incense, silver, sea shells, and lapis lazuli contributed to the dominance of those cities in the Early Dynastic Period.12 The prestige of these sea journeys became part of the potent symbolism watercraft acquired. Descriptions of overseas voyages occur throughout the dynastic period as well. A few royal monuments also provide illustrations of the laden hulls returning successfully from dangerous journeys. 13 References to seaborne trade with other nations are many, including the lament of a shipwrecked sailor from the Middle Kingdom. 14” ([Ward, 2000, p. 140](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=148&annotation=N2PX2XQU))

“Unfortunately, we are _unable to directly compare Egyptian and Med1~erranean hull construction because no seagomg Egyptian nor riverine Mediterranean w~terc_raft have been excavated. Comparing Egyptian nver boats and Mediterranean ship construction, especially across 500 years, would be like com~aring apples and oranges. In addition, the earliest excavated Mediterranean ship dates to Egypt's Dynasty 18 (c. 1318 B.C.), a time for which_ we have no remains of Egyptian craft of any kind. Comparisons between the two tradition~ can highlight contrasts in shipbuilding ph1los_ophies, but it is impossible to tell whether the distinctions we see relate to time, vessel type, or cultural and economic factors. The late Bronze Age Uluburun shipwreck near Kas, Turkey, is the oldest excavated Mediterranean seagoing hull. The lack of frames, along with the presence of a thick central timber and several edge-joined planks, recorded but not yet fully studied, demonstrate methods of hull construction similar to the nautical technology of Egyptian shipwrights who built river craft. Both the Uluburun and excavated Egyptian river vessels used thick central strakes, not keels. Some New Kingdom models and representations, however, illustrate a projecting central timber on seagoing and so-called "travelling" vessels, as well as on the obelisk barges of Hatshepsut. Christopher Monroe has suggested that these projecting timbers provided longitudinal stability and rigidity. 15” ([Ward, 2000, p. 140](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=148&annotation=EVXF5JMV))

“One of the most technologically advanced and economically powerful cultures from the ancient world evolved along the banks of the Nile River and drew its strength from the vessels that plied its waters. The earliest attempts at crossing its waters may have been made on bundles of reeds gathered at the river's edge. Buoyant reed bundles tied together served many purposes in Egypt, from fishing and hunting hippopotamus to providing platforms for ritualized mock battles between boat crews or ferrying the dead to immortality. But our first representations of watercraft seem to be connected to warfare and domination. It is possible that the lwL•lv• Lllll' cov, I I l\arly I ynasti hull at /\h lmi mny omnwmorc l' lh rol' of swift, Innμ,, nd norrow vess '18 in the formation of th st, le; llwir burinl, ll sls lo the immens wealth of ils ',rly rul'rs. When lh 'Y buill Khufu I more than 4,500 years ago, Egyptian shipwrights translated the simpl papyrus raft into an extraordinary work of art and complex engine ring that reverberates with the majesty of a state so powerful that it could afford to build a 43-meter-long hull of imported wood and bury it beside a pyramid for eternity. The dedication of resources becomes even more awe-inspiring when we realize that another disassembled and three complete, but now vanished, vessels surrounded Khufu's pyramid. While the wood type and dimensions of the unexcavated Khufu II hull are unknown, its deckhouse was about the same size as that of Khufu I, made of cedar, and shares at least some component dimensions, suggesting a ship of similar size, requiring a similar investment of labor and capital. The rock-cut, brick, and small wooden hulls and boat graves located in pyramid complexes of the later Old Kingdom testify to decreased wealth, possibly as a result of a drier climate and slowly deteriorating economic and social conditions. After Khufu, the next known boat burials date to Dynasty 12, when one of the most powerful groups of rulers in Egypt's history held the throne. At Dashur, five, or perhaps six, cedar papyriform boats paid tribute to the recently dead Senwosret III and honored, through emulation, the legendary rulers of the Old Kingdom. A planked model only a fifth the size of the Dashur hulls buried outside the tomb of a highly respected official at Lisht suggests that the Dashur hulls represent a comparatively large investment. Also at Lisht, and other Middle Kingdom pyramid complexes, are the remains of working vessels built of sturdy, straight, short planks, fastened together with deep mortise-and-tenon joints and ligatures, and reinforced with walls of wood intricately connected in a framing assembly. The massive construction of such hulls allows us to comprehend more easily the incredible transportation and engineering feats involving stone monuments weighing hundreds of tons.” ([Ward, 2000, p. 141](zotero://select/library/items/Z98WYCE6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UD954MWU?page=149&annotation=HZHY6PUH))
