### Braudel's four main events of the Late Bronze Age Collapse

At first sight, the dramatic historical events are the first to capture our attention. But what a strange history this is! Nothing about it is immediately comprehensible, and on reflection the picture becomes evenless clear. The collapse of the Hittite Empire in about 1200 happened quietly, with less disturbance than a sandcastle softly subsiding. And we cannot work out who was responsible. About thirty years earlier, in about 1230, the Mycenaean palaces were almost all destroyed, and many cities on the Greek mainland and islands were abandoned. Here again, there is no obvious culprit: those who used to be held responsible, the Dorians, the last Indo-European invaders of ancient Greece, did not arrive until the end of the twelfth century, some hundred years later at least, or so archaeology now tells us. Indeed, as one serious historian has asked, somewhat tongue in cheek, was there ever a Dorian invasionat all?7 As for the Peoples of the Sea, the key figures in these apocalyptic times, we glimpse them only on the two occasions when the Egyptians crushed them in battle. We may not be surprised to find that they survived these bloody defeats. But who were they exactly? They remain a puzzle to historians: when confronted by a dramatic disaster which knocked out several civilizations, and by the almost total shipwreck of the Bronze Age itself, they would like some clear explanations—but these are hard to come by. There are four separate groups of events to deal with: The Hittite Empire (the Hatti) collapses in about 1200. The Mycenaean palaces are destroyed and burned in about 1230.8 The people whom the Egyptian documents variously describe as the Peoples of the North, the Peoples of the Islands, or the Peoples of the Sea, head for Egypt and are defeated twice in 1180 and 1225 approximately (dates of which we can be reasonably sure). A long period of drought strikes the Mediterranean at the end of the second millennium B.C. Was this last player, the climate, the most important of all?
