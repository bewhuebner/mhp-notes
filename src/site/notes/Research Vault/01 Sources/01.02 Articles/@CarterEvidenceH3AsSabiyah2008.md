### Ubaid pottery distribution around [[Persian Gulf\|Persian Gulf]] shores

“This evidence principally consists of sites on the eastern side of the Arabian Peninsula bearing Ubaid pottery. Around 40 coastal and inland sites are known from the Central Gulf region (Oates et al. 1977) with a further scattering of exclusively coastal sites in Bahrain, Qatar and the Lower Gulf \[Fig. 1\]. Recent discoveries show that Ubaid pottery is distributed as far as the easternmost portions of the Arabian Gulf, in Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al-Qawain and Ras al-Khaimah (Jasim 1996; Haerinck 1991; Uerpmann & Uerpmann 1996: 132).” ([Carter, 2014, p. 92](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=3&annotation=IF74TKCM))

### structural evidence at [[As-sabiyah\|As-sabiyah]] (h3)

“At least three, possibly four, separate structures have now been exposed; their extent and stratigraphic relationships remain to be determined by further excavation. Numerous other structures and walls are visible outside the excavated area, mostly concentrated in the higher parts of the mound. The structures themselves are built of undressed flat slabs of local stone (beach rock and red sandstone). Mortar and plaster were not used, and the walls survive to six courses in places, up to 0.47 m in height.” ([Carter, 2014, p. 92](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=3&annotation=JW2LC9NY))

“Pottery is comparatively frequent at H3. Macroscopic examination indicates that 80% consists of Mesopotamian Ubaid ware, both plain and painted.” ([Carter, 2014, p. 94](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=5&annotation=TGV59AUS))

“The model measures 14.5 cm long by 7 cm wide, with a maximum surviving height of just over 5 cm. The tips of the prow and stern were broken off in antiquity, and have not been found: comparable Ubaid-period models from Eridu and al-Ubaid indicate that sometimes they curled round (Lloyd & Safar 1981: Fig. 111; Hall & Woolley 1927: Pl. XLVIII). Certain structural features are evident: pairs of incised undulating lines are visible descending from both sides of the prow and stern; it is unclear whether these join at the centre of the vessel’s sides. These are reminiscent of the wavy lines painted on the sides of the Mashnaqa vessel (Theusen 2000: Fig. 5). If not decorative, they may indicate rope binding the reed bundles, the junction between reed bundles, or the join between different materials.” ([Carter, 2014, p. 95](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=6&annotation=NCPCG2UV))

### Z: were masts used on reed boats? boat model from eridu ‘mast socket’ different than [[As-sabiyah\|As-sabiyah]] boat model

==“The most famous published example is from the Eridu cemetery, though identification of this item as a boat has been challenged ([[Research Vault/01 Sources/01.02 Articles/@StrasserboatmodelsEridu1996\|@StrasserboatmodelsEridu1996]]; cf. Bourriau & Oates 1997). The Eridu example is quite different from the H3 model, or the Ubaid-period boat models published from Mashnaqa and Al-Ubaid, the chief dissimilarity lying in the breadth of the Eridu model’s beam and the presence of a ‘mast socket’. No mast socket is evident on the H3 example; this does not prove that it does not represent a masted sailing ship, as bipod masts may have been used which do not require a socket. Casson (1995: 13) states that bipod masts are suitable for reed vesels, where no part is strong enough to support a pole mast, though Vosmer (2000: 151) allows the possibility of a pole mast being used on Bronze Age reed vessels. At present, therefore, we cannot ascertain whether the vessel represented by the H3 model was a sailing craft, or whether it relied on another means of propulsion (rowing, punting). Considerably later model boats from the Ur cemeteries are associated either with oars or punt poles (Woolley 1934: 71, 145), though these may represent only river- or marsh-boats rather than sea-going vessels.” ([Carter, 2014, p. 96](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=7&annotation=IIJ4TK9V))==

“Some of the most exciting finds from H3 consist of reed impressed bitumen slabs and fragments, many of which bear barnacles on one side. These are interpreted as the remains of bitumen-coated reed-bundled seafaring boats or ships (see below).” ([Carter, 2014, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=8&annotation=6QBP7Z73)) 
“Another interpretation is that the pieces represent the remains of other bitumen-coated reed-bundle structures whose function involves submersion, e.g. fish-traps or fresh-water containers to be towed behind boats.” ([Carter, 2014, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=9&annotation=QXSIPAQ2))

“Comparable material from Ra’s al-Jinz (see below) was found to have probably originated from northern Iraq, or less likely from Luristan (Cleuziou & Tosi 1994: 756), but this is not directly relevant to the H3 finds. Bitumen seeps are reported in Kuwait, near Burgan (Potts 1995: 563), while reeds are reported to have grown within living memory in the Sabiyah area.” ([Carter, 2014, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=9&annotation=FS5PSAVI))

“The clearest parallels for the H3 pieces are with fragments of bitumen from Ras al-Jinz (RJ-2), Oman, dating to the second half of the 3rd millennium B.C., some three millennia later than the H3 examples” ([Carter, 2014, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=9&annotation=9RECWVG5)) 
“There can be no doubt that the Ra’s al-Jinz bitumen represents the coating of Bronze Age ships. Some of these may have been entirely of reed construction, with others of reed and stitched-plank construction; Cleuziou & Tosi suggest that evolution from one variety to the other is evident within the Ras al-Jinz bitumen, the change occurring at around 2300 B.C. (1997: 69).” ([Carter, 2014, p. 99](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=10&annotation=4WKYJLJV))

“Both the H3 model and the bitumen pieces indicate a vessel type which falls into McGrail’s class of reed boat, defined as “bound bundles of reed lashed together (coiled basketry) to produce a hollow form, and waterproofed with bitumen” (1984: 290). He states that the hollow form would be strengthened with a light framework, and places the type in class C12 “skeleton-built with waterproof envelope made by transformations” (1984: 290, 298). We have no evidence as to whether there was or was not an inner framework in the H3 vessels, but wood would not necessarily be required to make one: tightly lashed reed bundles running inside the hull at right angles to the main bundles may have sufficed.” ([Carter, 2014, p. 99](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=10&annotation=QEIFDNAA))


==“Apart from the glyptic evidence mentioned above, and the archaeological evidence of bitumen-covered reedbundle ships from Ras al-Jinz, there is also textual evidence that such vessels were in use by the Bronze Age. An Ur III text from Girsu gives a list of boat-building materials which includes vast quantities of reeds, and bitumen “for the coating of Magan type boat”, while another Ur III text details 900 kg of bitumen stripped from a boat (Cleuziou & Tosi 1994: 746, 754).”== ([Carter, 2014, p. 99](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=10&annotation=ZMEDBB9B))

==“Similar techniques were used until the last century in the marshes of southern Iraq: [[Thesiger, WIlfred\|Thesiger]] describes how the Marsh Arabs coated their boats with bitumen from Hit, near Baghdad (1994: 113). In the case of wooden ‘canoes’, the old coating was chipped off, and new melted bitumen was applied over the upturned boat with a roller (Thesiger 1994: Pl. 48, 49). The coating was said not to last over a year, and to be a quarter of an inch thick (Thesiger 1994: 112-113). During the 19th century, bitumen-coated reed boats known as tarada were used in the marshes, though by Thesiger’s time these appear to have been made with wood. Instead, he describes smaller vessels made of reed bundles ([[zaima\|zaima]]). These were coated externally with bitumen, but Thesiger’s source stated that such craft could only be used for one year, as the bitumen coating could not be renewed==(Thesiger 1994: 114, Pl. 16).” ([Carter, 2014, p. 99](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=10&annotation=W4GVX26G))

“Another important find consists of a painted ceramic disc, which appears to depict a boat with a bipod mast. This would be the earliest known depiction of a sailing vessel, and settles some of the questions raised above.” ([Carter, 2014, p. 101](zotero://select/library/items/95QP46HC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDYMAYDV?page=12&annotation=MXSQXIMF))
