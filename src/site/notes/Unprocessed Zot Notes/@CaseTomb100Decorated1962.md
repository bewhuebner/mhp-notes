“Green led a second expedition in 1898-9 when the so-called decorated or painted tomb, a rectangular brick-lined and plastered pit with painted walls and brick partition, was discovered. He formed the opinion that it had been robbed two or three years previously. The paintings were removed and transported to the Cairo Museum. Green's full-size copy of them found a home in the Griffith Institute, Oxford (pI. 1). The monument has not been uncovered since 1899, and is reputed destroyed.” ([Case and Payne, 1962, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/MNAF7ZFG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FVM5PZ2D?page=1&annotation=AV2TCFVX))

“Some of the painted motives are strikingly matched in art which is either definitely Protodynastic or generally assumed to be so. These motives are enumerated below for ease of reference to figs. 4 and 5. (I) The hero or heroic attitude. (2) The king, conqueror, or leader shown at enlarged scale, (3a) threatening prisoners who may there or elsewhere be shown, (3b) in a row, (3c) bound together, and (3d), like other subordinates, kneeling on one knee in submissive attitude. (4) The priest dressed in a skin. (5) Cloaked figures in resting or submissive attitudes, presumably with feet tucked in. (6) Affront to lions. (7) The trussed ox. (8) The groundline.” ([Case and Payne, 1962, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/MNAF7ZFG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FVM5PZ2D?page=8&annotation=CGWRVJXA))

“The contrast in types of boats has been noted often. Their courses may be intended as opposed-the Gerzean boats heading south as painted on the wall and the foreign ship north-and their associated colours are certainly contrasting. (Contrasting colours of various motives are shown schematically in figs. 4 and 5). 

The Gerzean ships, painted red, white, and green, are associated with passengers or crew with red skins, namely the helmsman of the largest ship (pI. I b), the typically Gerzean figure swaggering under its awning, the figure before him, and those gesticulating above. Other figures with red skins include the prisoners, the men with crooks confronting the conqueror, the similarly typical Gerzeans on the partition, the hero, the lion-affronter with red weapon, the priest and offerer. These figures face various ways. 

==In contrast the foreign ship is painted black, with a black passenger. Other black figures are the conqueror with black mace, the figure possibly struck by a red throwing stick, and a badly preserved possibly swaggering figure below.== This contrast in colour is emphasized by the odd juxtaposition of black and red antelopes in the centre of the wall (fig. 5, bottom right), by the pairs of black and red lions (fig. 4), and by the other animals, including those caught in a trap (pl. I b). 

In general, typical Gerzean features are associated with red, but not with black. Of the black motives, the foreign ship and the macehead have been claimed by scholars as Asiatic in origin and associated with intruders. These intruders were defined by Winkler from rock-drawings and termed Federschmuck-Leute and later 'Eastern Invaders'. Their drawings show a marked contrast to those which can be identified as Gerzean and portray some frequent or significant motives painted black in the tomb the leader at enlarged scale, and possibly threatening a prisoner," the macehead, and the foreign ship. On the other hand, the long kilt, and possibly the hero (a conception also claimed as Asiatic) appear in these drawings and are associated with red in the tomb.
