“The Nag el-Hamdulab Cycle bridges the iconographic worlds of the Predynastic and Dynastic Jubilee images; it is a hybrid of the two. Whereas Predynastic scenes are either one long illustration, a fluid blending of the events, or represent individual vignettes from the cycle (DARNELL 2009), the dynastic scenes — from Narmer forward — are more often broken up by the key events, divided into registers, just as the Hamdulab tableaux appear to separate certain events, and assign particular symbolism and meaning to each tableau of the greater cycle. The Nag el-Hamdulab scenes stress the nautical aspect, the Predynastic focus of the event, but divide the event into distinct sequences. The Nag el-Hamdulab Cycle is also the earliest group of complex images of religious activity incorporating the king wearing a recognizable crown of pharaonic regalia, and the last of the large, nautical Jubilee cycles of the Naqada II period. Whereas earlier the concept of kingship was an important element — like the bulls and falcon in the Qa-a Wadi Jubilee cycle — beginning with the Nag el-Hamdulab Cycle, the presence of the physical king presiding over the events takes precedence over symbolism alluding to royalty.” ([Eyckerman et al., 2010, p. 308](zotero://select/library/items/W5LVBCFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BX62EGKH?page=14&annotation=7LQWCKZM))

“Boats are among the most interesting elements for dating during late Predynastic and Early-Dynastic times. The “sickle-shaped” boat with slightly “clubbed” ends, so characteristic of Nag el-Hamdulab, is closely related to type I of Cervicek’s boat typology (CERVICEK 1974, pp. 98-138). “Sickleshaped” boats are most frequent on decorated pottery, dating to Naqada IIC-D (GRAFF 2009, p. 171), and for rock art they are characteristic of the Naqada I and II periods (HUYGE 2002, p. 197). But the prows and sterns of the Nag el-Hamdulab boats turn up higher compared both to those on decorated pottery, and the vast majority of the Naqada I-II rock art boats. Boats with high prow, but without the “clubbed” ends, occur during the Naqada III period (HUYGE 2002, p. 198), and the Nag el-Hamdulab boats seem to be at an intermediate position.” ([Eyckerman et al., 2010, p. 312](zotero://select/library/items/W5LVBCFI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BX62EGKH?page=18&annotation=GL2APTQD))
