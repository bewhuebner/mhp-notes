### concept of the "ship as a symbol"

“The boat has been of crucial importance in most Neolithic riverine, coastal and insular cultures around the world. Various studies related to the boat in Scandinavia, South-East Asia and the Pacific adopt what has sometimes been called a “ship-as-symbol perspective.” Quite universally, it has been observed that the boat played a crucial role during political, military and funerary activities, but also during ceremonial events. It was used as a powerful symbol in artistic productions. The parallel with Egypt, especially during the 4th millennium BCE, is obvious enough to encourage us to apply this theoretical perspective to Naqadian boat depictions. Although comparative studies focussing on cultures that are separated both in time and space are very hazardous and prevent us postulating any direct parallel, this very rudimentary analysis shows the benefits of conducting researches in which anthropological concepts allow us to enrich our argumentation.” ([Vanhulle, 2018, p. 173](zotero://select/library/items/5NCX8UVI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V3U495SZ?page=1&annotation=QRD5G2Z4))

“Some motifs were used metaphorically in order to embody important ideological notions and it appears that the boat was the most powerful of these symbols. It should then not be considered for what it is, that is to say a mere vehicle, but for what it means as a symbol inside the whole scenography. This is not especially easy because this meaning could change according to the medium and the context in which the image was used. We thus have to deal with some sort of “contextual polysemy.” If this symbolic nature of the boat has been punctually acknowledged by some authors, 

	the important use of the boat as a symbol (... ) has a long history in Egypt. Some societies (...) have found in the horse a powerful image of authority, which elevates and almost encompasses the rider. The Egyptians used the boat, often decorated in a distinctive way, to achieve the same effect, sometimes turning it quite literally into a shrine 
	
it has never been really analysed.” ([Vanhulle, 2018, p. 174](zotero://select/library/items/5NCX8UVI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V3U495SZ?page=2&annotation=TN2YK5YE))

“The first manifestations of boats in pre-Pharaonic art can be traced back to the Naqada I period (c. 3900–3600 BCE), where they essentially appear on White Crossed-Line pottery. With the exception of some peculiar examples showing what looks like a boat depicted from above, the composition is almost always related to symbolic hunts in which the boat plays an active role. Indeed, it is regularly depicted harpooning dangerous animals in the total absence of any human hunters (Fig. 1). The fact that the boat itself is shown harpooning the animals would confirm its status of protector of the Cosmic Order of the world. Moreover, mixing the desert and the valley in a single scene thanks to the depictions of plants and animals typical of these two ecosystems could be a way to signify that the boat, which should be understood as a metaphor for an ordered human group headed by a cast of leaders, dominates the whole universe. This suggests that the underlying message is related to the concept of “Order over Chaos.

If Order was basically maintained by the cohesion of a social entity, the ruler was, in the eye of its subjects, its true guardian. Before the first personification of the king in art, Order was signified through motifs that structured the whole composition; motifs such as human figures or boats. Chaos was mainly embodied by dangerous and charismatic animals, by dead bodies, by anarchic movements or by a combination of these possibilities.” ([Vanhulle, 2018, p. 174](zotero://select/library/items/5NCX8UVI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V3U495SZ?page=2&annotation=KXVYH6X5))

“Naqada II (c. 3600–3300 BCE) is a key period as it marks the beginning of the expansion of the Naqadian culture throughout the whole Egyptian territory, in the Levant and in Lower Nubia. Naqadian society became progressively highly hierarchical and witnessed the elaboration of a complex ideological and religious system built around a cast of people, perhaps already of royal status. The boat is then used in compositions where the concept of the primacy of Order over Chaos is only one aspect of a more global discourse. Wellknown examples are the Gebelein painted linen and the wall painting from Tomb 100 at Hierakonpolis. Their iconography consists of a naval procession that dominates a set of scenes dedicated to the expression of order and control of the wilderness. This procession, which is imposing and brings balance to the whole composition, is composed of several sickle-shaped boats and a sacred barque, thus comprising a mixture of political and religious power inside a unique scene. It is largely accepted now that this iconography refers to some kind of festival, perhaps a pre-formative equivalent of the Pharaonic Heb Sed. It appears then that from the second half of Naqada II, powerful ideological concepts were expressed by professional artists through the depictions of ceremonies focussing on the person of the king and in which these concepts play a central role.” ([Vanhulle, 2018, p. 175](zotero://select/library/items/5NCX8UVI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V3U495SZ?page=3&annotation=79CYDIKU))

“By the end of Naqada II and the beginning of Naqada III, naval processions appear mainly on prestigious ivory knife handles and in rock art. Among theses productions are the famous Gebel el-Arak knife (Naqada IID-IIIA) and the Metropolitan knife handle (Naqada IIIA). The former is sometimes considered to be of Mesopotamian origin because of the oriental nature of several of its iconographic motifs. There is no need here to reopen the longstanding debate about the origin of its decoration, since it is largely accepted now that, despite an undisputable influence of Mesopotamian imagery, this work of art is a genuine Naqadian production. If an oriental influence is indeed difficult to deny, Egyptian artists adapted these exogenous motifs to their own needs and ideology. The Gebel el-Arak knife handle shows a double naval procession organised in two lines: one is characterised by ceremonial boats with upraised extremities, the other by classical Naqadian sickle-shaped boats. These two levels are separated by several dead bodies. We can thus observe this dichotomy between an ordered and powerful naval procession and a more chaotic scene, the former encompassing the latter in order to maintain it into control. Moreover, the upper register of this side of the handle is decorated with military activities and is then also dedicated to the expression of power, violence and domination. The decoration of the Metropolitan Knife Handle adds to this double naval procession a pedestrian procession, both of them heading towards what seems to be a sanctuary (Fig. 2). The last example known to us of this particular iconographic theme has been engraved on one of several related rock panels in the vicinity of Aswan (Fig. 3). This rock art, which is currently considered to date back to the Naqada IIIA period, this time shows the procession in an undoubtedly royal context since a crowned king and its court progress alongside the boats.” ([Vanhulle, 2018, p. 175](zotero://select/library/items/5NCX8UVI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V3U495SZ?page=3&annotation=AS6XDU8K))

“It appears that iconography witnessed a strong phase of increasing complexity and standardisation during Naqada II. All of this comes to an end with the advent of the First Dynasty. Indeed, once the king is personified for the first time as the ruler of Egypt, the boat is no longer needed to express all these primordial notions. The king is now the personification of Ma’at. Proof of this is the confinement of the barque, much smaller than the king, in a corner of the Narmer Palette and its very pragmatic function on administrative ivory labels commemorating festivals or economical expeditions. However, the boat of the Narmer Palette still has a political and religious aura since it dominates beheaded enemies and is surmounted by the god Horus. The First Dynasty is in fact a phase of transition: if the boat has lost its original meaning in iconography, it can still designate the royal institution. Several engravings of that period, in South Sinai and in Lower Nubia, show boats surmounted by a serekh. These boats, showing great artistic qualities and thus engraved by professional artists, are territory markers commissioned by the State. They testify that the new Egyptian State controls the area and that its influence goes as far as these remote regions. This last function of boat images did not survive the Second Dynasty. It is interesting to observe, however, that the boat remained an ideogram in the hieroglyphic system” ([Vanhulle, 2018, p. 177](zotero://select/library/items/5NCX8UVI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V3U495SZ?page=5&annotation=UYNGG7VG))
