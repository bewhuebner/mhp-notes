“The most reliable way to date the petroglyphs is to use stylistic analysis to compare rock-art with mobiliary art in the context of a better understood chronology. Since there are boat depictions among the Nile Valley predynastic and pharaonic artifacts, comparable to a number of petroglyphs, it will be these examples which are most useful in dating the desert images. It should be possible then to date other images and scenes by association with known examples. In order to date the boat images in the Central Eastern Desert stylistically it is necessary to study them within the overall context of comparable material with known dates (Table 1), mostly found in the Nile Valley.” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 44](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=76&annotation=VGL436N9))

“Overall, a change in the tilt of the Earth at 8200 BCE caused weaker ‘insolation’ (solar heating) of the North African landmass and therefore a weakening of the West African monsoon. The orbital effect was probably enhanced by the collapse of the North American Laurentide ice sheet around 6000 BCE. Computer modeling shows a feedback between subtropical vegetation and precipitation. Grasses and other plants no longer collected water, releasing it back into the atmosphere. The result was a rapid decrease in vegetation. This turned the area of what is now the Sahara into arid desert within only a few hundred years after the second aridification event. At that point the Eastern Desert reached the climate situation at which it is today, although it probably now has fewer trees due to charcoaling by the local Bedouin. 

The effect on settlement and economy is outlined by Kuper & Kröplin (2006) and comprises four phases. Firstly, there was no permanent human settlement (outside the Nile Valley) in the Sahara, although there were nomads active, until the arrival of monsoon rains in around 8500 BCE. At that time the Sahara Desert extended four hundred kilometres further south than it does today (A in Map 3.5). Then, the rains turned the Sahara into an attractive landscape and therefore conducive to settlement (B in Map 5). Next, after 7000 BCE cattle pastoralism became established together with widespread human settlement (C in Map 3.5). Finally, from 5300 BCE the monsoon rains retreated southward to the pattern they occupy today, and apart from in the oases permanent settlement in Egypt was restricted to the Nile Valley (D in Map 3.5). By 3500 BCE desert conditions were established and even favourable areas such as the highlands of Gebel Uweinat and the Gilf el Kebir (Map 3.6) were no longer permanently occupied. Water supply magazines had to be established in the Fourth Dynasty on the Abu Ballas trail to the Gilf in order for mineral and trade expeditions to take place. Egypt was divided into the ‘Black Land’ of the narrow Nile floodplain and the ‘Red Land’ of the desert. However, there was still further gradual aridification until the final event around 2000 BCE, and the establishment of the arid conditions which exist in modern times.” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 71](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=103&annotation=IW9NEQGK))

“The typology presented here divides the boat petroglyphs into five categories: ‘Sickle,’ ‘Incurved Sickle,’ ‘Square,’ ‘Incurved Square’ and ‘Flared.’ ‘Sickle’ vessels are approximately semi-circular and symmetrical (‘a’ Figure 6.1), making identification easy, but making determination of the direction of travel often problematic. ‘Incurved Sickle’ boats are similar, but have a stem and stern which turn inwards (‘b’ Figure 6.1). The ‘Square’ type is defined by its straight hull with upright prow and stern (‘c’ Figure 6.1), while the ‘Incurved Square’ boat has a straight hull but incurved stem and stern (‘d’ Figure 6.1). The ‘Flared’ example has a flat hull shape like the ‘Square’ type, but is asymmetrical, having both an angular stem and stern (‘e’ Figure 6.1).” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 189](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=221&annotation=66NS3IS4))

“A cabin, which is present in 131 boats (16%), is the second most common additional feature to the hull (after crew). Although sickle boats are more likely to have a cabin than square ones, the feature is not common in either case. This presence of a cabin is not evenly divided over the other types of boats since as many as 36% of the incurved square boats and only 11% of the square boats are shown with a cabin. The incurved square boat cabins are always small, and square or rectangular in shape. Thus it could actually be a type of screen rather than an oval-shaped cabin seen in other boat categories. Wadis Baramiya and Abu Mu Awad stand out as having the greatest number of boats with cabins, while elsewhere vessels with cabins are quite evenly spread through the survey area (Map 6.1).” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 192](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=224&annotation=MRRA5RDN))

“A method of propulsion is a rare feature on any boat image and only 49 (5.5%) are shown with oars. None of the boat categories have a significant proportion of oars. Paddles are never indicated. Sometimes the simple line of the oar is continued above the deck to indicate the rower, but there are no examples of a recognizable human figure rowing. Wadi Umm Sala has the highest number of oared boats, although this is from a small overall total. Oars are generally rare in the southernmost wadis, but Wadis Abu Mu Awad and Abu Wasil have significant numbers among the small overall total. Depictions of oars are as rare in the northern wadis as in the southern ones (Map 6.2).” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 193](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=225&annotation=APK9MPGC))

“Those with associated animals and human figures are found at sites deemed to be ‘Predynastic.’ This follows the pattern in the Central Eastern Desert rock-art that predynastic boats are usually present in groups and associated with animals and people, often engaged in hunting. On the other hand, pharaonic boats almost invariably appear in ones or two’s.” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 199](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=231&annotation=N26UHYIC))

“Altogether, only 47 boat petroglyphs in the Central Eastern Desert, out of nearly 900, can be readily identified by stylistic comparison with predynastic artifacts from the Nile Valley.” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 204](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=236&annotation=XL7XPZ25))

“On the one hand, a large majority of boats that can be identified as square-hulled or incurved are predynastic. On the other hand, all but only half a dozen of the pharaonic boat depictions are sickle-shaped.” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 216](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=248&annotation=JCEK2JRN))

“It is notable that predynastic boats tend to be associated or integrated with human and animal images, and can be seen in large groups. On the other hand, pharaonic boats are usually found in ones and twos (Figure 6.12), and are never integrated into complicated scenes consisting of many images. Even when possibly associated with animals and people, they are situated on the edge of such scenes. Thus, there is a clear distinction between predynastic and pharaonic boats in the way they are located on the rock face, and therefore also a clear difference in the reasons for their creation. There is also a pattern to the distribution of the pharaonic images. They are well represented in Wadis Baramiya and Hammamat, which are direct routes to the Red Sea, but also in Wadi Abu Mu Awad, which is not, but is a route to the eastern gold mines.” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 221](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=253&annotation=G8GSL66F))

“That depictions of animals, people and boats have been hammered on rocks in Egypt is not surprising, but their presence in the desert is. This is particularly notable concerning the boat images in what was always a semi-arid area. I will especially focus on the associations and ‘impossible combinations’ of animals, human figures and boats in the middle of the desert.” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 265](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=297&annotation=TLC6AN7W))

“As noted in Chapter Seven, dynastic boat petroglyphs tend to be distributed along wadis which lead to mines and quarries. Therefore, a (largely funerary) ritual explanation for their creation is less likely and a motivation related to mining and quarrying activities is more probable, in contrast to activity in the predynastic period.” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 265](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=297&annotation=EDR7IGVV))

“The scene recorded from the burial chamber of T100 (Figure 8.4) has been interpreted as a barque procession and a precursor to an early pharaonic festival cycle (Williams & Logan, 1987), although the tomb is usually dated from its contents to Naqada II c (c.a. 3650 BCE, Hendrickx, 2006: 728). It is thus presented as being different in function to the images in the rock-art. The depiction is seen as a narrative rather than a dramatic intertwining of viewer and viewed. Williams and Logan’s interpretation of T100 in terms of ‘smiting,’ ‘dancing’ and the ‘pharaonic cult cycle’ are made within the confines of this approach. They divide the tableau into five sections (Figure 8.5), each representing one aspect of the later so-called pharaonic cycle and state that “it can be concluded that the Heb-Sed (a festival seen as accomplishing the ruler’s rejuvenation), in its funerary context, already formed the central event in the greater cycle that outlined the expected duties of leadership that relate to the funerary complex at least by the end of Naqada I. It can also be concluded that many, perhaps most, Naqada period representations comprise fragments, extensions, elaborations, or abbreviations of that cycle whose major elements can be traced more clearly in great funerary/ representational complexes of the Thinite period (Dynasties 1-2) and Old Kingdom” (Williams & Logan, 1987: 272).” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 274](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=306&annotation=QXD6M8JT))

“Boats are somewhat better delineated, although even here half the latter are indeed simply hulls. Among the remainder the detail is sufficient to suggest that the petroglyph creator was closely familiar with a particular vessel. Those in the ‘Integrated’ scenes, the ‘frond’ boats and the pharaonic vessels are the most detailed. Thus, a considerable amount of the early rock-art represents ritual activity by the Naqada culture elite. A number of the animals, such as wild cattle and antelope would have come to the river to drink-such that it has been suggested that hunting would have taken place near to the valley settlements (Linseele & Van Neer, 2009: 62). However, the rock-art shows that hunting in the desert was seen as a necessary ritual activity rather than to gain food. Hippopotamus and crocodile hunting, and the dragging of boats-both Nile Valley activities, are seen in conjunction with the hunting of desert animals. The integrated nature of the tableaux and the resonance of dance displayed by the ‘arms raised’ figures display the power to control the wild. To accomplish this a small hunting group would undertake an expedition, which could have been completed in around a week-a not over-demanding task. Unfortunately, due to the lack of archaeological material, it is not possible to determine whether the petroglyph sites were continually revisited. Their general small scale (the largest having around a hundred images) gives the impression of brief stops during hunting expeditions.

“If we place the Central Eastern Desert evidence within the context of Egyptian rock-art overall, we can also trace the development of the Egyptian state. In the early predynastic period travellers from a number of independent centres in the Naqada culture went into the desert in order to conduct ritual hunting. We can also see a particular link between the boat petroglyphs at Kanais and those in the valley at Hierakonpolis. But the variety of expression within a common culture, as shown by the widespread distribution of the ‘frond’ boats (Map 1) and ‘arms raised’ figures, suggests diverse elite groups from several centres operating at this time. However, the ‘frond’ boats are limited to an area bounded by Wadi Hammamat in the north and Gebel Silsila in the south-in other words the core area of the early Naqada culture. Evidence particularly from Hierakonpolis and Mahasna indicates that hunting, feasting and animal burial were important elite activities.” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 306](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=338&annotation=NJ9FINN6))

“In Naqada III, which straddles the Protodynastic and Early Dynastic periods, only three boats and three serekhs, two of Narmer, can be found in the survey area. The distribution of Naqada III boats in Egypt and Nubia (Map 2), with a massive concentration at Sayala (Engelmayer, 1965) shows the progress of Egyptian expansion. Moreover, the presence of many Naqada III motifs at ‘Dominion Behind Thebes,’ together with the Gebel Tjauti tableau, mirrors the shift of power towards the northern Naqada culture territory dominated by This (Abydos) towards the end of the Protodynastic period, allied with an extension southwards of the Naqada culture into Lower Nubia. Depictions of Naqada III style boats in the latter area at Gebel Sheikh Suleiman and on the Qustul incense burner show these vessels engaged in combat-a rare activity apart from the battle on the Gebel Arak knife handle. In contrast, the few Naqada III boats in the Central Eastern Desert are singletons devoid of context. The precipitate decline in depictions during this period may be accounted for by the decline in the number of independent elite lineage groups as one royal family emerged in the state formation process. The focus of a united Upper Egypt was directed to the west of the Nile and south into Nubia.” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 307](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=339&annotation=PA5HLQM6))

“Throughout the pharaonic period the desert was a resource exploited for its mineral resources, in particular gold and Bekhen stone. There is textual evidence that pharaohs only sent one, or at most and untypically, two or three, mining expeditions during their reigns (Breasted, 1906; Harrell, 2002: 239). Therefore, the approximately 100 pharaonic boats and 200 hieroglyphic inscriptions outside of the Hammamat quarries support the contention that these activities were not on an industrial scale before the Greco-Roman era. The desert was still a resource for ritual action in the Nile Valley during this period. Gold in pharaonic face masks and stone for sarcophagi were utilised for their sacred preservative and regenerative powers. Finally, the quarries in the Red Sea hills provided columns and other elements for imperial building in the Roman Empire. The boats, inscriptions and part-time shrines mark the routes to the gold mines and quarries, and on the trade route to India. The ‘ship’s captain’ inscriptions, and indeed, some or all of the dynastic boat images, may mark journeys of ship personnel to the Red Sea coast, or constitute evidence of the naval teams in charge of resource transportation. Given that the missions to secure materials to be used in mortuary situations were endowed with a sacred character, combined with the ritually powerful predynastic sites, the Central Eastern Desert (and the Kom Ombo drainage Basin sites) have ‘ritual depth’ cf. Diaz-Andreu, 2001) in that a minority can be determined as purely secular until the Roman period.” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 309](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=341&annotation=4ZG6HKCH))

“Support for the contention that what is shown in the rock-art is (rare) elite activity comes from the frequency of creation of the scenes. Since the ‘Integrated’ scenes and ‘frond’ boats constitute a small part of the rock-art and could have been made by a comparatively small number of people, how ‘busy’ would the Central Eastern Desert have been? There are few petroglyphs dateable to Naqada II c/d-III, and the predynastic activity probably mostly occurred in the late Naqada I c-Naqada II a/b period. This may have been 200 years, but perhaps less as the lack of secure C14 results for the Naqada era compared to the First Dynasty, means that dating rests largely on pottery seriation. Given that there are 75 ‘Predynastic’ and 24 ‘Mixed’ sites in the whole survey area, and that each ‘Associated’ and ‘Integrated’ scene is judged to have been made contemporaneously, this means a minimum of one site was created every 2½ years. Even if we take an extremely low (but potentially feasible) 100 years for this period, and assume a lack of revisiting, it only means the creation of one site per year over the whole of the Central Eastern Desert in this time-span. 63% of the predynastic sites are in the southern wadis, 28 % in the central ones, but only 5% in the core central ones, with just less than 10% in the north. If only those disposed to create rock-art travelled into the desert, even in a restricted time period of spring and winter, they would meet very few people there, if anyone at all-especially outside the southern wadis. This assumes hunting as an elite and/or specialist activity, given the paucity of wild faunal remains in domestic contexts in the Nile Valley except in elite areas. If each member of the small hunting party (3-4 persons usually portrayed) was responsible for their own site, then the frequency of travel could be even less.” ([Lankester, 2013, p. 310](zotero://select/library/items/NRXZZPXB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NZ87JA9C?page=342&annotation=3X8FZ9PA))
