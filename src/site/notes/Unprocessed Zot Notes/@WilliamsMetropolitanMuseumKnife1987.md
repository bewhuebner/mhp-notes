“The major element is clearly the hull of a high-sterned ship of the type that appears on the Gebel el-Arak Knife Handle. Although the bow is not preserved, the hull and tall curve of the stern are very clear, as are the trusses that held it in position. At its base is a steering oar shown by the shape of the blade that appears to the right, and the shaft passes diagonally across the hull to end slightly above the hull inside the vessel. In front of the stern is a vertical pole; above it is a horizontal crescent. The crescent probably was attached to the pole, but a pit in the surface has destroyed the connection. This object is also shown on the Gebel el-Arak Knife Handle, where it is a standard or mast-rest. 

Amidships, next to the destroyed area is a rectangular mass with a rounded topalmost certainly a cabin. Recovered details include the curve of the roof, marked by vertical and horizontal lines in the mass. Above and to the left of the cabin are two shapes whose nature is not clear. One is the tip of a shape now lost. The second, a rectangular shape, is directly above the cabin. Immediately at its right edge is a bilobate mass that cuts slightly across the corner of the rectangle. The lower edge of the shape is well preserved, but the upper is more doubtful, and some detail may be lost. Above it, in turn, is a five-pointed rosette.” ([Williams et al., 1987, p. 248](zotero://select/library/items/A6VQ699C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FEPWSHCW?page=4&annotation=CF274CC9))

“The appearance of a pharaoh actually on a ship is most directly paralleled by the Qustul Incense Burner, as is the backward tilt of the crown.

Below the ship, and extending at least as far as the now-lost prow, is an area of vertical zigzag masses that represented water even before the First Dynasty. Just to the right of the boss is a group of lines that seem to show parts of a papyrus plant with one stem bent, very much like plants on the Scorpion Macehead.” ([Williams et al., 1987, p. 249](zotero://select/library/items/A6VQ699C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FEPWSHCW?page=5&annotation=CH9WKZD6))

“The most obvious shapes are three curved masses, clearly the hulls of three simple crescent-shaped galleys of the Naqada period type. The two vessels toward the right belong together, for the prow of the last overlaps the stern of the middle vessel as on the Gebel el-Arak Knife Handle. Above the stern of the middle vessel is an element that may be an animal head, also as on the Gebel el-Arak Knife Handle. Remnants of a cabin can be seen on the third (right) vessel, and on the middle vessel there are parallel vertical lines that meet in a curve at the top like those on the Gebel el-Arak Knife Handle. On the stern of the third vessel is a man, apparently kneeling, with an arm upraised. Traces of his beard are especially clear, and he holds a short crook in his upraised hand.” ([Williams et al., 1987, p. 249](zotero://select/library/items/A6VQ699C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FEPWSHCW?page=5&annotation=H5QPGLPW))

“The style and decoration date this piece to the end of the tradition of carved ivory knife handles. The design on the verso closely parallels the processions on Hierakonpolis ivories, and it contains elements that occur on the series of late pre-FirstDynasty monuments, especially the Bull Palette and objects of Scorpion and Narmer, even though details of the bark differ from those of Scorpion and Narmer; the star-shaped rosette also differs from rosettes carved on the stone monuments. The water and plant motifs are combined with the representations on the boss side as they are on the Scorpion Macehead.” ([Williams et al., 1987, p. 250](zotero://select/library/items/A6VQ699C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FEPWSHCW?page=6&annotation=MZ7XPDZB))

“To understand the significance of the composition, the Metropolitan Museum Knife Handle must be viewed in relation to compositions of comparable complexity. Central elements of the inquiry are: the river procession with the high-ended or sacred bark, the figure of the pharaoh with associated attributes, the prisoner, and the palace facade or sacrifice. Although other significant elements and details can be traced in them as well, these elements occur on a number of very important representations both in the Archaic Period and before. 

Several of the known representations with the bark as a central element are more complete or elaborate than the others, and they may serve as a foundation for a reconsideration of early art in this region as a whole.” ([Williams et al., 1987, p. 252](zotero://select/library/items/A6VQ699C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FEPWSHCW?page=8&annotation=YS6UTLSY))

“*The Qustul Incense Burner* – The most essential and characteristic representation of the bark procession is on a ceremonial carved incense burner from A-Group Qustul. Three barks are directed toward a serekh-palace faqade, the forward vessel under sail, the other two without visible means of propulsion. The rear vessel contains a stylized feline with a tentative version of the long neck shown on composite monsters on the palettes. The figure on the standard-pole behind appears to be a falcon, which would indicate that the feline is a deity. The feline is saluted by an onlooker. 

The center back is occupied by a pharaoh, as shown by the white crown and falcon that remain above a major break (the falcon may have been perched on a serekh). Behind the bark is a leaping antelope; in front is a tail, apparently of a dog of the kind shown hunting on the animal palettes. Here, the dog and antelope circle the bark as the animals on the palettes scramble around the central eye-paint dish. The bark itself is labeled by a harpoon-head. The forward bark is occupied by a bound prisoner who kneels on a sloping palanquin; behind him stands a guard who restrains him with a rope and who holds a mace, head downward. A crocodile swims below the procession.” ([Williams et al., 1987, p. 252](zotero://select/library/items/A6VQ699C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FEPWSHCW?page=8&annotation=B2A56KK3))

“It is clear, however, from these two processions and the Metropolitan Knife Handle, that the pharaonic bark procession to a paneled palace faqade was at this time (Naqada IIIa/Late Gerzean) a major symbolic theme of pharaonic art. In addition to the barks and faqade, the occupants of the barks also appear in some other, earlier representations. In the earlier compositions, however, the bark procession is only a part of a much larger scheme, or cycle, of themes. Parts of this larger scheme appear elsewhere in such a way that the existence of a standard cycle of themes can be inferred. 

*The Hierakonpolis Tomb Painting, Tomb 100* – The most elaborate two-dimensional representation of the Gerzean/Naqada II has been repeatedly discussed; individual elements and groups have been singled out for special analysis and comparison. However, the painting has not been treated as a single composition. That the painting is a composition rather than an arbitrary collection of motifs is clear from its general processional nature and from the four figures that face inward from the corners. In fact, the structure can be analyzed in much the same way as the Metropolitan Knife Handle. The balanced composition consists of four scenes, each with major constituent groups, or tableaux, and a central tableau. Each scene is dominated visually by at least one so-called sickle-boat or river galley. The galleys are shown without oars: they are thus not underway but moored, beached, or anchored, although this is not precisely indicated. Steering oars on the vessels toward the upper left, lower left, and lower right and anchors, indicate that the vessels, apart from the one vessel to the lower left (no oar is preserved on the upper right), were directed toward the corners.” ([Williams et al., 1987, p. 253](zotero://select/library/items/A6VQ699C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FEPWSHCW?page=9&annotation=VTLDCW3A))

“The most significant feature of the vessel is the small figure seated in a roofed booth at the stern. This figure is robed in white and has both an elongated white head and a flail that protrudes from the lap (fig. 14). The analogous figure on the Qustul Incense Burner is decisive, and it is clear that this is an early form of the bark procession as shown on the incense burners and the Metropolitan Knife Handle (since the latter is read boustrophedon, the arrangement is reversed). In addition to these major elements, three women seated below the right galley in the lower left scene face this vessel and may belong to it; they reappear in the scene directly above.” ([Williams et al., 1987, p. 254](zotero://select/library/items/A6VQ699C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FEPWSHCW?page=10&annotation=AHALRFK2))

“The most important fragment contains a bark and ship procession (fig. 15). Above, a bark proceeds to the right, steered by a man in the stern but not propelled. The stern bends up, forward, then upward again; the hull has bindings indicated on it. Remains of a cabin structure survive amidships. In front of these, a figure is seated in an enthroned position. He wears a brimmed crown or headgear, and a flail protrudes from his lap. Below, a galley with pointed stern proceeds to the right, with a helmsman and rowers seated forward and aft of a pair of cabins. Seated between the two cabins is a bound man, and a mace is suspended above his head from the aft cabin. Other details of the later bark procession occur also, the papyrus (?) plant behind the galley, the legs of a bird or animal above the bark, and a symbol-shape (?) above the seated royal figure. The pointed, crescent-shape of the lower galley and other features indicate a date of Naqada Ic-IIa for the representations.” ([Williams et al., 1987, p. 256](zotero://select/library/items/A6VQ699C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FEPWSHCW?page=12&annotation=6449AJEJ))

“In Tomb 100, the ruler returns to jubilation. He then sacrifices by smiting amid representations of activities. In the painted pottery of Naqada II, neither sacrifice nor apparatus are seen, but the galleys appear frequently. Wherever they appear with distinctive ancillary figures, they most often incorporate the dancing women of the jubilant return. This complex theme--jubilation, sacrifice, and other activities--marks the Scorpion Macehead, and it is probably this general theme which appears on that object.” ([Williams et al., 1987, p. 265](zotero://select/library/items/A6VQ699C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FEPWSHCW?page=21&annotation=UB67UW55))

“The Metropolitan Museum Knife Handle is closely related to the Gebel el-Arak Knife Handle, and the hunt and victory are combined on the same object, with the symbolic symmetrical group. The hunt appears as a major subject on palettes, also with the antithetical or symbolic symmetrical group. Its connection with the cycle is clearly reinforced by the palette in the Metropolitan Museum that has a serekh resting on the serpent that surrounds the pigment dish; the animals are arranged symmetrically. It also appears on ivory knife handles and combs that show files of animals in various stages of organization or disarray. Above these files are combinations in which a serpent is torn by birds of prey or intertwined serpents are trampled by elephants. The bird-serpent combination can be traced in stages on an important series of pottery vessels, especially a jar and bowls from Qustul. In the Late Naqada/ Early Thinite Period this combination appears in the scene of scavenging at the battlefield on the Lion Palette and, as a rebus, on the Narmer Palette.” ([Williams et al., 1987, p. 266](zotero://select/library/items/A6VQ699C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FEPWSHCW?page=22&annotation=Y6A6K9A2))

“The portable representations of the sacred bark from the Turin Linen onward do not show the vessel rowed. In this feature, the general shape of the vessel, and in other details, the sacred bark maintained a remarkable iconographical consistency and exclusivity. Because of a series of progressive modifications, the vessel's career in art could be followed in a linear progression from Amratian/Naqada I times to the First Dynasty. The bark's subsequent elaboration, and, indeed, indispensable participation in pharaonic myth and ritual, need not be recounted here, except to note that it became involved in the gigantism of the pyramid age. Khufu's huge ships are a warning that to understand the original meaning of the bark, one must turn to the earliest and simplest representations as we have done above. 

If the sacred bark had an origin in the tiny hunting-skiff of Amratian/Naqada I times, it had already outgrown this early function by the time of Tomb 100, where it almost rivaled the galleys in size, an incipient gigantism that indicates its much greater religious function.” ([Williams et al., 1987, p. 270](zotero://select/library/items/A6VQ699C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FEPWSHCW?page=26&annotation=95RHNT5U))

“In several representations, the pharaoh is depicted within the bark wearing the HebSed garment. The central tableau in Tomb 100 is the Heb-Sed run or dance, a representation also found in Djoser's substructure. Except in the earliest example, the Gebelein Turin Linen, the bound prisoner is facing the opposite direction from the king, and jubilation accompanies the return of the royal barge. The Qustul Incense Burnershows where the ceremony took place-at or in a palace-faqaded building.” ([Williams et al., 1987, p. 271](zotero://select/library/items/A6VQ699C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FEPWSHCW?page=27&annotation=CICNSCQV))

“In summary, a First-Dynasty date for the Gebel Sheikh Suleiman monument cannot be maintained from any traces on the relief itself. It remains a document of exceptional interest, however, documenting a hostile encounter between inhabitants of Lower Nubia and representatives of the state during the period of state formation in Egypt.” ([Williams et al., 1987, p. 284](zotero://select/library/items/A6VQ699C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FEPWSHCW?page=40&annotation=INZ8Z736))
