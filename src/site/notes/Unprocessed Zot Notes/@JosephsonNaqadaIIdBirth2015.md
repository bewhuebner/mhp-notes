“Most of Dynasty 0 was was spent at war with the Delta people, presumably to control and protect trade routes from the Levant, the source of invaluable wood, wine, and other commodities.4 This conflict apparently was instigated by King Horus, one of the earliest rulers of that dynasty. Narmer (ca. 3020 BC), the ultimate king of this dynasty, is credited with the final conquest of the lengthy war and was, in turn, followed by Aha (ca. 3000 BC), the first king of Dynasty 1. The Archaic period ends with the death of the last monarch of Dynasty 2, Khasekhemwy (ca. 2660 BC), marking the beginning of the Old Kingdom.” ([Josephson and Dreyer, 2015, p. 166](zotero://select/library/items/NKSQ2DQY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4CVK9URP?page=2&annotation=ASD7BMYM))

“The second handle, at the Metropolitan Museum, depicts on its obverse a man wearing a mostly obliterated white crown grasping the head of a fallen captive, perhaps an early version of a smiting scene (see ig. 2).20 Two rows of kneeling men, presumably his retainers, are lined up behind the king. Above and to the left of the king are traces of a wood and matting structure, most likely his aH-palace. The reverse displays a leet of boats. We have earlier offered our opinion that it may celebrate the submission of Hierakonpolis to Abydos.” ([Josephson and Dreyer, 2015, p. 171](zotero://select/library/items/NKSQ2DQY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4CVK9URP?page=7&annotation=3BDV5RZQ))

“Negative evidence, reinforcing our understanding of the rise of kingship in Naqada IId, is found in Hierakanpolis tomb 100. This impressive burial chamber, dated to Naqada IIc/d, is decorated with painted scenes depicting battles, boat processions, hunting, and herding, as well as various animals. Two men carrying symbols of authority similar to crooks, but uncrowned and with no other regalia suggesting kingly status (fig. 6) offer support of our thesis. Since there are two of them, they are more likely to be chieftains than kings.” ([Josephson and Dreyer, 2015, p. 171](zotero://select/library/items/NKSQ2DQY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4CVK9URP?page=7&annotation=H7MKFALU))

“The rise of kingship is a natural consequence of social and territorial dominance by the strongest male member of an expanding society who attains a leadership role by the process we now refer to as the primacy of the “alpha male.” The requirements for the administration of the growing territories and increasing populations with its attendant necessities of documenting taxation and trade, making the invention of writing essential. This is borne out by the earliest examples that refer to the origin and transport of commodities. Finally, by providing a special status to the monarch, including his ability to act as a conduit between the gods and ordinary people, organized religion extended the kings’ power and control over his subjects.” ([Josephson and Dreyer, 2015, p. 177](zotero://select/library/items/NKSQ2DQY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4CVK9URP?page=13&annotation=MB57RSA2))
