# 1 Trade Before Empire; Empire Before the State (c. 3500–2686)

“As early as the Nagada IIC period, an influx of items, images, and ideas from the greater Mesopotamian world arrived in Egypt. Their effect on the elite of Upper Egypt—a stratum of society eager to adopt new vocabularies of power into its semiotic system—was to inspire immense creativity. Although the duration of this interchange was short, ideas introduced at this time (especially regarding the technology of sealing in order to mark ownership, the utility of writing, the communicative power of heraldic imagery, and the design of niched buildings of monumental proportions) helped forge the visual insignias of high social status in the late Predynastic and Protodynastic period as well as pharaonic iconography throughout the Early Dynastic period and beyond.10” ([Morris, 2018, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/JDKXRVLF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T6H4DPKC?page=29&annotation=RLIXMPQ2))

“The manner in which the rulers of Abydos came to assert their sovereignty over their rivals in other polities is not clear. Superiority in military matters may well have played an important role. Signs of large‐scale violence and militarization are difficult to discern in the archaeological record, but the numerous scenes of combat and of prisoners that ornamented the walls of the Painted Tomb at Hierakonpolis, the ivory hilts of knives, and the most elaborate of cosmetic palettes provide evidence that elite identity and martial prowess were already closely entwined in the transition between the late Nagada II and the early Nagada III periods.” ([Morris, 2018, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/JDKXRVLF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T6H4DPKC?page=31&annotation=CDIBBEQZ))

“Trade between Egypt and Canaan intensified in the Nagada IIC–D period, and imports of pottery and raw materials appeared in unprecedented quantities in the graves of Upper Egypt’s wealthiest citizens. Following the unification of Upper Egypt in Nagada IIIA, however, markedly elite graves and also graves containing Canaanite imports narrowed to only two sites: Abydos and (to a far lesser degree) Hierakonpolis. At this point trade emissaries were stationed at sites like Tel Erani (level C) and Hartuv, in order to contract with local vintners, who now produced, at least in part, with Egypt’s market in mind. The several hundred wine jars originally interred in tomb U‐j—amounting to an estimated 4,500 liters—are well known, but lesser quantities of similar storage jars were discovered in other Nagada IIIA tombs at Abydos. Clearly, the power of wine to intoxicate and to impress was a factor the new court was eager to use to its advantage.” ([Morris, 2018, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/JDKXRVLF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T6H4DPKC?page=35&annotation=46GP2HBS))

“In Canaan as well, the change in policy had a dramatic effect on the archaeological record, leading to the establishment not only of Egyptian enclaves within Canaanite settlements (e.g. Tel Erani B, Tel Halif II, Tel Lod IV) but also to new settlements that exhibited a primarily Egyptian‐style material culture (at ‘En Besor III, Tel Ma’ahaz I, and Tell es‐Sakan). The pottery at both types of sites typically included significant quantities of imported Egyptian wavy‐handled transport vessels as well as numerous Egyptian‐style bowls and breadmolds fashioned in local clays. The assemblage strongly suggests a resident Egyptian population that oversaw a thriving Egypto‐Canaanite commercial enterprise.” ([Morris, 2018, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/JDKXRVLF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T6H4DPKC?page=35&annotation=PJGPMQUY))

“Relying on martial imagery on the Narmer Palette as well as on somewhat ambiguous archaeological evidence, these scholars view Egypt’s presence as established by force and maintained by military control—a textbook instance of informal imperialism. 

Other scholars, proponents of the “commercialization model,” however, envision the relationship as having been peaceful and collaborative. Certainly the evidence seems to fit the model of a trade diaspora that Abner Cohen developed with respect to Hausa enclaves in Yoruba communities. He defined these settlements as 

	interregional exchange networks composed of spatially dispersed specialized merchant groups which are culturally distinct, organizationally cohesive, and socially independent from their host communities while maintaining a high level of economic and social ties with related communities who define themselves in terms of the same general cultural identity.”

“From the mid‐First through the Fourth Dynasties (c. 2950–2494), then, the Egyptians evidently preferred intensive contacts with far‐off trading centers like Byblos and perhaps also Yam to relations with their nearest neighbors. In  addition, as discussed in the following chapter, the court sponsored exploratory expeditions aimed at identifying mines, quarries, and other means of accessing wealth. By and large, however, the government’s focus had shifted to a more direct harnessing of the human, animal, and agricultural resources of the Nile Valley.” ([Morris, 2018, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/JDKXRVLF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T6H4DPKC?page=37&annotation=727Y5GQV))

“For the kings of Abydos, the first and most pressing task internally was to unify Upper Egypt under their rule. If we lack the scorched earth or mass graves that would unambiguously signal the political defeat of Nagada and Hierakonpolis sometime around the transition to the Nagada III period, other subtler signs betray the newly subordinate status of these polities. At Nagada, an economic downturn is evident throughout the mortuary record, and most dramatically in Cemetery T, which previously had been the burial ground of the town’s rulers and their circle of intimates. Although the cemetery continued in use, it no longer contained the type of opulent tombs that suggest an unmitigated access to power. The substantive shift from the South Town toward what would become the Dynastic town of Nubt may also have taken place at this period. Analogously, the Painted Tomb cemetery at Hierakonpolis hosted no more painted tombs, and the center of gravity for the town as a whole shifted toward the floodplain. Although it has been suggested that the latter settlement shift was prompted by a series of low floods, it is worthwhile to note that, following the conquest of the powerful Nubian capital of Kerma in the early Eighteenth Dynasty, the older town was largely abandoned—its population having been transferred closer to the river. Such mandatory evictions, as the Inca knew, acted to unsettle a vanquished population and to render it vulnerable.” ([Morris, 2018, p. 24](zotero://select/library/items/JDKXRVLF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T6H4DPKC?page=38&annotation=M4NAUHIX))

“Just what the relationship between Buto and the Upper Egyptian powers had been prior to this point would be fascinating to ascertain. Recent excavations have revealed the town’s precocious engagements with Syrian traders, and archaeological evidence suggests that lucrative maritime connections may have prompted southern elites as early as the mid‐Nagada II period to establish a commercial enclave at Buto. Certainly by the time that the ruler of Upper Egypt was laid to rest in tomb U‐j, the southern court and the same heron‐topped shrine of Buto that Narmer would later honor for its collaboration were in close contact. Ivory tags from the tomb imply that the heron‐shrine (or the polity it represented) sent the deceased ruler parting gifts to take into the afterlife—though it is unclear whether these gifts imply a relationship of dominance and submission, of an enclave to its sponsor, or of diplomatic courtesy.” ([Morris, 2018, p. 28](zotero://select/library/items/JDKXRVLF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T6H4DPKC?page=42&annotation=FCUW3MCP))
