“It is therefore logical that assumptions put forward in the field of interpretation are often closely linked to the cultural (especially iconographic) and archaeo-zoological evidence of the Badarian and Naqada I-Ill periods (c. 4400-3150 BCE) and to that of the first two dynasties (c. 3150-2650 BCE). Setting aside (too) simplistic explanations, for instance that the rock drawings would be the outcome of casual pastime or merely exercises of artists’ apprecntices, four main motivations have been put forward to account for the ancient Egyptian rock art tradition: 1) magic; 2) totemism; 3) religion; and 4) ideology.” ([Huyge, 2002, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/CGK3ASIT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B2GXX254?page=2&annotation=UXVGJNEM))

“Fortunately, from the Predynastic through the pharaonic period, ancient Egyptian civilization seems to display a single line of progress and a considerable degree of conceptual conservatism. In fact, what occurred in Egypt between  c. 3200 and 3050 BCE (the time of state formation) was not an abrupt change of iconography, but rather a profound formalization, standardization and officialization. Image-making passed from a less disciplined ‘Preformal’ artistic stage to a ‘Formal’ canonical phase. This change is indeed huge, but basically it is a change on the exterior. The content of the iconography (the themes) and the underlying beliefs (the meaning and motivation) remain very much the same and will continue to be so for several millenia.” ([Huyge, 2002, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/CGK3ASIT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B2GXX254?page=4&annotation=H3LAR67F))

“The Upper Egyptian town site of Elkab, ancient Nekheb, especially noticeable in the landscape because of its massive Late Period mud-brick enclosure walls, is situated on the east bank of the Nile, about 80 km south of Luxor. The site, investigated by Belgian archaeologists since 1937, had been continuously occupied in antiquity from the Palaeolithic onwards. The presence of prehistoric rock drawings in the environs of Elkab had been recorded in the early part of the last century, and an extensive rock art survey was undertaken between 1979 and 1983 by the Committee for Belgian Excavations in Egypt (Huyge 1984a; 1984b). This project led to the discovery of eleven petroglyph localities, together containing well over 500 incised and hammered figures. The majority of these localities are situated at the mouth of Wadi Hilal, a dry stream channel that ultimately joins the Nile. By far the most impressive is the ‘Rock of the Vultures’, an 80 m long and 30 m high steep-sided inselberg of Nubian sandstone, exhibiting 350 rock drawings and hundereds of Old Kingdom hieroglyphic inscriptions.

“The oldest horizon that could be identified in the Elkab rock art (Horizon 1) can with good confidence be attributed to the Naqada I period (c. 3900-3650 BCE); the youngest (Horizon VII) spans the Christian and Arabic eras.“ ([Huyge, 2002, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/CGK3ASIT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B2GXX254?page=6&annotation=BK3SVPXN))

“Diagnostic for Horizon II are primarily sickle-shaped boats (often with slightly ‘clubbed’ ends) and right-angled vessels of Types I and VII respectively in P Cervicek’s boat typology.” ([Huyge, 2002, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/CGK3ASIT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B2GXX254?page=7&annotation=5LABPN94))

“*The Terminal Predynastic and Early Dynastic: Ideology* – What distinguishes Horizon III from the earlier horizons is the prominent ideological component. Indeed, a whole series of rock drawings (boats, anthropomorphic figures, and animals alike) can directly or indirectly be associated with royal ideology. All these images ultimately serve the same purpose: they externalize and proclaim symbolically the dominion, triumph and power of the ruler. In all probability the societal motivation underlying these figures is popular royalism and the growing recognition of the ruler as the upholder of the universe. Because of their unequal quality of manufacturing and the simplicity of their structural associations, these drawings are certainly not part of formal iconographic constructs that have been conceived and traced out by ‘professional’ ideologists and artisans. At the same time, however, it is manifest that every one of these representations has directly been inspired by the standardized, elitist imagery of the Terminal Predynastic and Early Dynastic periods. The ideological component in the rock art might therefore be labelled ‘semi-official’; it is in all probability the product of an ‘educated’ local elite, perhaps priests and other dignitaries.

The reason this ideological component turns up in Horizon III can be found in the radical socio-political and religious reforms of the Terminal Predynastic and Early Dynastic periods. The official political unification of Egypt in late Naqada III times (Naqada IIIb or Dynasty 0), accomplished on a cultural-technological level already at the Naqada II stage, resulted in a far-reaching centralization of power and concentration of the governmental apparatus at the royal court. The concretization and personification of the state machinery also implied an hierarchical restructuring of religion and a royal annexation of the pre-existing devotional symbolism. As a consequence, certain fundamental religious practices, such as the concern for the cosmological order (a central feature in Horizons I and II), became less and less a public affair and increasingly a royal prerogative.” ([Huyge, 2002, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/CGK3ASIT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B2GXX254?page=13&annotation=4HSS3SP9))
