# Introduction

Ahoy crew and welcome back to the Maritime History Podcast. This time around we have Episode 003 - Predynastic Boating in the Egyptian Desert.

The title doesn’t really leave much to the imagination, and if you listened to the end of our last episode you’ll recall that we now turn our focus south, leaving the Ubaid People behind to look at what was contemporaneously happening in Egypt.

It’s roughly in the same timeframe, at least, because the Ubaid Period in Mesopotamia began fairly near to the beginning of Egypt’s Predynastic Period, we can say round about 6000 BCE. But, the Ubaid Period concluded before Egypt’s Predynastic Period did, so we will have some overlap with timeframes and such as we navigate the coming episodes. The Ubaid Period in Mesopotamia concluded around 3700 BCE, but today as we consider Egypt, we will be examining the millennium from 4000 to 3000 BCE. Where it makes sense to allude to events elsewhere I’ll certainly do so, but you’ll have to wait until future episodes before I can fill in some of the blanks at higher fidelity.

All right then. Egypt. Everyone already has a mental image forming in your mind’s eye at the simple mention of ancient Egypt, no doubt about it. Most of the memorable and glamorous Egyptian visuals are from later in their history than you might imagine. And whatever particular place or icon or artifact you’re imagining right now, there’s also probably some type of connection we could make between it and the water. The Nile River, specifically.

# The Nile in the Neolithic

It might be a trope at this point to mention that the historian Herodotus wrote down the same view that many ancients held. That is, that the very land of Egypt was a gift to the Egyptians made by the Nile River. (Herodotus, _Histories_, 2.5.) Egypt is the “gift of the Nile,” as many folks say today.

In the paragraph from his _Histories_ where Herodotus made this point, he is also focused on the alluvial deposits made by the Nile in its Delta. Greek sailors in the classical period sailing south to Egypt across the Mediterranean could bring up the rich black mud deposited by the Nile River when they dropped sounding lines more than a day’s sail north of the river mouth, which is just amazing. That of course calls back to a point from our first episode, too. The alluvial deposits of the Nile have buried much of the artifacts and archaeology of the Nile Delta region, unfortunately. (Wilkinson, Toby. _The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt._ United Kingdom, Random House, 2010, pp. 23—24.)

For our talk today that issue is thankfully not a big concern. I’m sure there are artifacts buried in the muddy Nile Delta that would contribute much to our current understanding, but for now we simply work with the information available.

Back to the Nile. Herodotus likened the river to a gift-giver bestowing the gift of life upon Egypt itself. Many modern historians liken the river to a conduit or a highway, a backbone, even. And all of these analogies are apt. I also like to think of it as the lifeblood of Egyptian civilization, with a current running south to north that continually flowed and kept the people there alive and their culture flourishing for millennia.

At one point in the even more distant prehistoric past, the Nile was maybe not quite as necessary. Today it cuts through what is otherwise just the Sahara Desert. But in the Mesolithic, there were more consistent summer rains that kept seasonal pastures and cattle herders in business away from the Nile itself. But, after 5000 BCE the climate of the region began to shift and as the rains became unreliable, the desert crept in. Eventually only the Nile remained, and as the climate moved, human population was also forced into the narrow band of of verdant growth that traced the banks of the Nile following its reliable seasonal flood. (Wilkinson, 2010, p. 11.)

# Nile Geography



# Desert Rock Art Boats

# Nag el-Hamdulab

- Conclude with discussion of this site. Appears to basically be the bridging evidence between pre-dynastic and “dynastic.” Shows first images of pharaoh presiding over “Following of Horus” event with boats that bear similarities to Naqada vessels, but also include the kingship imagery

# Conclusion

  

- Open with Herodotus quote comparing Mesopotamia to Egypt and focusing on the Nile; similar reed boats in predynastic Egypt; rock art depictions in eastern desert; then focus on potential cultural “bleed” between two areas with Gebel knife (similar to Warka Vase), tomb 100 depictions, and the Naqada II depictions showing pre-dynastic similarities and growth of Egypt
