# Introduction

Ahoy again crew, and welcome back to the Maritime History Podcast. Today we have Episode 002 - Boating in Ancient Mesopotamia. The title really says it all.

Last time we kicked off the podcast by taking a whirlwind tour of the prehistoric Mediterranean. There’s a lot we left out, a whole lot more we just barely glossed over, and only a few highlights that we took the time to focus on. I hope it was helpful to lay the groundwork for why maritime history matters and how things gradually unfolded as time ticked its way closer to our current era.

Today we are moving east and away from the shores of the Mediterranean altogether. Don’t worry. We’ll make it back there before too long, but for a little bit it will be important to focus on Mesopotamia, a place you have likely heard labeled as “the cradle of civilization.” It’s in Mesopotamia that we will see the connecting links from the prehistoric boats and earliest sea crossings that we discussed last time, evolving into a more thorough maritime commerce. It helps, too, that we’re now moving into the era of “history” in the sense that a written record will soon underlie much of what we discuss. Archaeology, experimental archaeology, and numerous other disciplines must still inform the discussion, though, and I will continue to do my best to weave it all together into a coherent thread.

# the first sailors were farmers

The short intro fact today is one that we also saw in the last episode. This time, we can safely say that the first sailors were farmers. That sounds a bit weird on one level, but as we saw last time, the spread of farming and agricultural advance was clearly tied to maritime movement, especially on Mediterranean islands. It’s no different in Mesopotamia, despite the absence of islands.

Why shift to look now at Mesopotamia when we started last time in the Mediterranean? Well, I already mentioned that, in some ways, it’s a good way to link the prehistoric to the later rise of civilization, and that is my main motivation today. But, in some ways, this region is not far removed from the Mediterranean. We’ll see over time how the various civilizations that came and went in this area had direct ties to other civilizations that were connected to the Mediterranean. In the same vein, Mesopotamia also connected the Mediterranean to places even further east, so as we mentioned last time, the concept of information and commercial flows along maritime routes, viewing them as a network, this concept will be a recurring theme for us at just about every juncture.

One very important fact that we will also see occur and reoccur is that, well, water is an important and necessary piece of the puzzle that must fall into place before any people group can flourish. Saltwater isn’t quite as helpful, but rivers and fresh water, in particular, are key, and the ideal spots that seem to pop up frequently are those where fresh water and salt water meet. Mesopotamia has few such zones, and one of those involves the confluence of the two main rivers of the region, the Tigris and Euphrates, where they meet the Persian Gulf. These two rivers meander southeast, and they eventually get closer to one another right as they merge into the gulf, forming an alluvial plain and marshland area.

The two rivers are what give the entire area its name, a name affixed by the ancient Greeks: “Mesopotamia.” [[Research Vault/02 Atomic Notes/Mesopotamia means 'land between the rivers'\|It comes from the Greek root words “meso” and “potamos”, which respectively mean “middle” and “river,” so the land’s name literally describes it as a “land between the rivers.”]][^1] The name is perhaps somewhat of a misnomer since most of the major cities that would later develop were actually located outside the bounds of the two rivers themselves. But, the general point still applies since it’s the rivers that gave civilization a chance to emerge there in the first place.

As we saw last time around, agriculture began to emerge in the Near East around the year 9000 BCE. [[Research Vault/02 Atomic Notes/much island life in the Neolithic Mediterranean began as farming made second-best island places more tolerable\|With time it spread both over land and was taken over the sea on dugout boats and local reed canoes.]][^3] The particulars of this evolution differ from place to place and region to region, but since we’re in Mesopotamia today, let’s zoom in a bit to talk about the specifics there.

Most of the ancient settlement of Mesopotamia was limited to the upper spans of the Euphrates and Tigris river valleys, getting into the foothills of the Zagros and Taurus Mountains, and even further north into Anatolia. As climates changed and the ability to irrigate land was developed, civilization moved further south toward the Persian Gulf and the outlets of the two rivers. 

Other than the area where the great rivers meet the sea, Mesopotamia is perhaps less inherently maritime than other regions we’ll discuss eventually. Still, the Tigris and Euphrates and their tributaries play a central role for our discussion today, just as they did for the advent of farming in ancient Mesopotamia. The rivers fed areas of fertile soil where advances in agriculture could take full root (pun intended). [[Research Vault/02 Atomic Notes/agriculture began around 9000 BCE in the ancient Near East\|This led directly to the area being perhaps the first area on earth to sprout what we can accurately label urban civilization]][^2], although we’ll talk more about that aspect later.

For now, it’s important to outline what the region could grow abundantly and well, and what was lacking or difficult to grow. The main crop in the valleys along the Tigris and Euphrates was grain of various types, but grain used mainly for food. This was crucial to keep growing populations of both people and their domesticated animals fed, but beyond that, other natural resources are important to building and industrial projects. [[Research Vault/02 Atomic Notes/Ancient Mesopotamia lacked local natural resources\|Stone and solid timber were two things particularly absent from Mesopotamia’s natural resource pools, and the lack of timber is most noteworthy when it comes to our focus on maritime history.]][^4] One thing the region did have in abundance, especially in the alluvial plain where the rivers met the Persian Gulf, was reeds.

So, lacking timber there was not much opportunity to develop a culture of true boat building. There were probably some logboats in the region, just as we’ve seen elsewhere, but from the archaeological record, they do not seem to have been the most prevalent. Rather, the cultures of the region seem to have used the abundant reeds of the marshland to build their water vessels. And they may have used reeds to build numerous other things, as we’ll circle back to in a bit.

Ultimately, the reeds of this region are very sturdy, and since they grow at lengths of up to 15 feet or 4.5 meters, well, you can build boats and other structures of impressive sizes when a reed that large is your building material. The people of the modern-day Mesopotamian Marshes actually still use these reeds to build entire structures, sometimes even entire floating villages that are accessible only by boat. The people are fittingly known as the Marsh Arabs. Perhaps a quick look at these people could be an instructive segue for us today, actually.

# the marsh arabs

It’s important to make clear that the Marsh Arabs who inhabit modern-day Iraq and Iran, they most likely have no direct ties or lineage that traces back to the ancient Sumerians who would have inhabited the same region, those who we’ll talk about later today. Still, it must be said that there are intriguing similarities between them and how they lived in the region, separated only by the passage of time.

The modern Marsh Arabs have suffered greatly in recent years, especially in the 1990s when Saddam Hussein’s government in Iraq waged a brutal religious persecution that targeted the groups living in Iraq’s marshland. Because they largely lived off the rice and grains that could be grown in that area, the government’s efforts to divert the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and drain the marshlands had a devastating effect on their homes and societies. Almost half a million Arabs lived in the Marshes in the 1950s, but that number fell to fewer than 20,000 at one point. More brutal tactics were also used by the government forces as they drove the Marsh Arabs from their homes, but after Hussein’s government fell in the early 2000s, the natural flow of the rivers was restored, and the marshlands have slowly recovered. In turn, many of the Marsh Arabs have been able to return and try to regain their former way of life.

As we said a moment ago, the Marsh Arabs are known for their floating villages and buildings made out of reeds. A particular type of large building that you may have seen examples of is called a _mudhif_; it’s a ceremonial house that is used almost as a community center of sorts, where large gatherings are held. The size of these buildings is impressive given that they are built out of reeds, and as I mentioned, smaller dwellings and reed platforms are also used to build what are effectively floating villages. We see similar examples of native reeds used for the same purpose on Peru’s huge freshwater lake, Lake Titicaca.

So then, the use of reeds for maritime applications is clearly a common thing in similar environments around the world. Reeds are less durable than wood, to be sure, but when reeds are your most accessible natural resource, you make do with what you have. They are at least easy to work with, and for their weight, they are strong and flexible, not to mention they also float, so it’s perhaps not surprising to hear that along with buildings, the inhabitants of southern Mesopotamia have used reeds to construct boats for basically all of the region’s history.

# Ubaid-period boat models

To bring it all full circle, though, we should also look at what the ancient Mesopotamians used reeds for, and in a way, we already have.

It stands to reason that they used reeds for basically the same applications that we’ve seen the Marsh Arabs use reeds today. Sumerian cylinder seals actually show depictions of reed houses and buildings that were built 5,000 years ago, so although the organic building material has long since broken down and left no discoverable trace, we can tell from those seals and other artifacts that the Sumerians and most likely their predecessors used reeds to build dwellings. (also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk_Trough)

Similarly, and let’s be honest, the real topic we’re here to discuss today is their use of reeds for the construction of boats. And here, thankfully, we have a few more traces remaining that help us get a picture of the ancient past.

These traces come from the earliest defined prehistorical period where man inhabited the alluvial plains of Southern Mesopotamia, a period called the Ubaid period. [[Research Vault/02 Atomic Notes/The Ubaid people are the earliest identifiable widespread culture in Mesopotamia\|The name comes from the archaeological site where a large amount of artifacts from the period were discovered, Tell al-Ubaid]][^5], and over time as more artifacts from the period and culture have been found, a clearer picture has emerged about just how widespread trade and movement of people and goods actually was in one of the earliest defined periods of southern Mesopotamian history. [[Research Vault/02 Atomic Notes/Ubaid culture in southern Mesopotamia emerged into the world’s first cities around 4000 BCE\|The Ubaid Period, while certainly more active in later stages, began as far back as 6,500 BCE.]][^6]

The maritime evidence from this period comes in the form of boat models, for starters, but then there are a few other things that also tie into the whole discussion. A good boat model to consider was found at a site called as-Sabiyah, located in modern-day Kuwait, and not far from the modern shoreline of the Persian Gulf. The site is further south than the exact area where the Tigris and Euphrates meet the gulf, but it is not far removed at all.

Here, archaeologists unearthed a a small ceramic boat model. It measures 14.5 cm long by 7 cm wide, and slightly more than 5 cm high.[^7] At some point in history past, the prow and stern of the boat were broken off, but it is still a very useful artifact. In its context, the boat model indicates that the earliest Mesopotamian settlers used boats, and when we combine this evidence with more that we’ll discuss today, it also shows that they traveled fairly large distances, relatively speaking. The raised prow and stern of the boat are evidence that it is a model of a reed-boat since reed boats typically have a curved prow and stern where the ends of the reeds are tied off and bent. There is even some thought that lines painted on similar models and faintly present on this one might be meant to signify rope bindings used to keep the reed bundles tight.[^8]

There have been other models of this style and material found at other Ubaid sites, namely at Eridu and Tell al-Ubaid. There is one outlier model that I find interesting to think about, although honestly, I’m not sure it actually is a boat model, to be honest. This one was also found at Eridu, and compared to all other Ubaid boat models, it is a lot wider; it has a wider beam is what you would say in maritime lingo. On top of that difference, which makes it look more rounded instead of long and narrow, there’s also a socket about one-third of the way between the two pointed ends. If, for the sake of discussion, we say that this is indeed a boat model, it’s perhaps logical to look at this socket as being in the place you would expect a mast might be put. So, some scholars who do view this model as being of a boat have taken to calling this a mast socket.

My personal opinion is that this artifact is probably not a boat model, but those who view it as such also can then hold it up as one of the world’s oldest examples of a boat that used a mast and, therefore, a sail.

Quickly, I think it is unlikely to be a boat model because a reed vessel’s hull would be a pretty poor material to actually be able to support the forces that a mast and sail outfitting would actually exert. Reeds would have been likely to have a mast just punch through the hull. But, even apart from this, there is a theory I find convincing that says this artifact is actually a spinning bowl that was used by ancient weavers to pull and twist wool fibers together to form yarn for textile creation. Many similar examples of spinning bowls have been found in graves and contexts tied to women of the ancient world, and this fact combined with the fact that no other example of sail technology appears in the archaeological record of Mesopotamia until almost 2,000 years after this artifact is dated, all of these factors contribute for me to the conclusion that it is more than likely not a boat model.[^9]

Still though, as we’ve seen, other boat models abound in the archaeological record of ancient Mesopotamia. They are actually among the oldest objects found in Mesopotamian graves, and from graves and tombs down through Mesopotamian history, we find various styles of boat models made from various materials.[^10] In some ways, these models down through time give us a unique window into the evolution of boats and ships, but we’re not there quite yet, and we will continue to revisit the topic going forward.

# from boat models to real boats

Ultimately, small-scale models of boats or ships are just representations of an actual boat; they obviously aren’t the real thing. That point raises some interesting questions for me about why humans seem to have this natural inclination to make small likenesses of “real” things. I don’t have any answers to that question, but it’s interesting to consider.

Practically speaking now, though, we should move from looking at scale models of things to taking a look at the real thing, to boats and what we can conclude about their usage in ancient Mesopotamia.

At a basic level, as we think about reed boats in general, and as we’ve seen the shape of the boat model from as-Sabiyah, we can see that the fundamental shape of a boat like this would be similar to the boats we use for similar functions in the modern world, things like canoes in particular. The major difference among boats of this shape is the material used to build them, and then secondarily the question of their framework or construction style.

Reed boats would probably not have been candidates for the type of boat and material that would last for long journeys, for while reeds were resistant to water at first, with time and usage, they would tend to become waterlogged. This degraded the maneuverability and stability of a vessel, and on top of that, anyway, a reed boat would have needed to be built with a very specific design to have been very seaworthy in the first place. They were much better suited to riverine conditions and to use in the marshlands of the northern Persian Gulf.[^11]

The bigger question really is how useful reed boats would have been on the Persian Gulf proper, and to begin to answer that question, we have to add another natural resource into the discussion.

# bitumen as a sealant

This is where bitumen comes into the picture. The first thing to answer is what even is this thing called bitumen. It’s not a word we typically use in the U.S., although a quick etymology check tells me that we Americans tend to call this substance “asphalt”, which derives from the Greek word for it, whereas the word “bitumen” derives from the Latin, instead.

Whatever you decide to call it, this substance was common in ancient Mesopotamia and the reason for its prevalence there remains still today. Bitumen is a naturally occurring substance that is quite similar to modern asphalt, as we said. It’s black and oily, but it’s also viscous and tar-like. It’s basically a semi-solid form of petroleum, so it makes a great sealant without too much work required. The Ubaid people were the first people to use bitumen on a large scale, and although bitumen has a variety of uses, it is relevant to maritime history because they used it to ‘waterproof’ their reed houses and boats. 

They originally used mud to seal their reed constructions, but mud was a poor sealant that had to be reapplied constantly as it broke down. Bitumen, on the other hand, was impervious to moisture and maintenance-free for the most part.

There are a few great examples from ancient texts that describe the prevalence and use of bitumen in Mesopotamia for the very purpose of sealing water vessels. Here’s a passage from the Roman writer Strabo’s work _Geographica_[^12]:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/research-vault/02-atomic-notes/bitumen-description-and-earliest-reference-to-use-in-boats/#strabo-bitumen" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



Babylon produces also great quantities of asphalt, concerning which Eratosthenes states that the liquid kind, which is called naphtha, is found in Susis, but the dry kind, which can be solidified, in  p217 Babylonia; and that there is a fountain of this latter asphalt near the Euphrates River; and that when this river is at its flood at the time of the melting of the snows, the fountain of asphalt is also filled and overflows into the river; and that there large clods of asphalt are formed which are suitable for buildings constructed of baked bricks. Other writers say that the liquid kind also is found in Babylonia. Now writers state in particular the great usefulness of the dry kind in the construction of buildings, but they say also that boats are woven with reeds and, when plastered with asphalt, are impervious to water. 

</div></div>


Another example from the Sargon Birth Legend has some intriguing parallels with the more widely known story of Moses from the Book of Exodus, [[Research Vault/02 Atomic Notes/Summary of Sargon the Great’s life\|but it also mentions a basket or boat of reeds that was sealed with bitumen.]]

> “My mother was a high priestess, my father I knew not. The brothers of my father loved the hills. My city is Azupiranu, which is situated on the banks of the Euphrates. My high priestess mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. She cast me into the river which rose over me. The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water. Akki, the drawer of water, took me as his son and reared me. Akki, the drawer of water, appointed me as his gardener. While I was a gardener, Ishtar granted me her love, and for four and ... years I exercised kingship.”[^13]

And finally we have a much more modern example from an explorer named Sir Wilfred Thesiger. In the 1950s and 60s he spent much time living with the modern Marsh Arabs and documenting their way of life. This passage describes his perspective upon witnessing their local watercraft being built, and in large part, this is the same type of craft and technique that ancient inhabitants of the same region would also have used[^14]:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/research-vault/02-atomic-notes/thesiger-on-marsh-arab-reed-boat-construction/#thesiger-zaima" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



“I once saw an interesting type of coracle, called a zaima (Plate 45), on a branch of the Euphrates below Suqash Shuyukh. Made of qasab and coated outside with bitumen, it was ten feet long and two and a half feet at its widest. The owner told me that a zaima would only last a year, as the bitumen could not be renewed. He demonstrated how to construct one. First he made half a dozen tight bundles of five or six qasab reeds rather longer than the length of the proposed boat, and fastened them securely together side by side to form the keel, leaving eighteen inches free at both ends, which he bent upwards. He next bent five long reeds into the shape of a U, passed the middle among the loose ends of the keel, and laced them back to the keel itself. He repeated the process at either end alternately, until he had built up the sides and ends of the hull. This framework he stiffened by tying into it a number of ribs made from two or three willow wands. Bundles of a few reeds, fastened one below the other along the inside of the boat, covered the top half of the ribs and formed the inner planking. Finally, he wedged three stout sticks across the boat as thwarts and secured their ends in place with lumps of bitumen. The zaima was now ready to be coated outside with bitumen. Nowadays even the poorest of the Madan possess wooden boats, but in the past, when communications were precarious and wood difficult to obtain, many probably used just this type of coracle. A circular coracle, called the quffa, used to be common around Baghdad. The farthest south I saw one was below Kut, near Sheikh Saad.” 

</div></div>


Ultimately then, we see from various descriptions that bitumen has been used to seal watercraft in this region for thousands of years, and as we’ll look at now, use of the substance for that same purpose almost certainly goes back far further. Much like the obsidian we discussed in our previous episode, bitumen can serve as a useful marker to trace the movements of ancient people.

# bitumen at as-Sabiyah

Thanks to a few archaeological sites from the region and some interesting artifacts, we can get a more clear picture of how bitumen, and another substance, became an important part of the growth of ancient societies. The first site is actually the same one where the boat model we already discussed was found, as-Sabiyah in Kuwait. As we said with that particular model, its shape and other traces seem to imply that it was modeled after a full-sized reed boat, but another artifact found at the site lends a lot more credence to this theory.

At the site, archaeologists also found a series of bitumen chunks. If these were simply chunks of a naturally occurring substance, obviously, that wouldn’t mean a whole lot in isolation. But here, these chunks bore the impressions of other objects that shed much more light on what the Ubaid people used bitumen for over 7,000 years ago. The bitumen chunks bore impressions of separate objects on each side, generally. On one side, we see the reverse-image impressions of reed stalks, just as we’ve discussed in depth already today. But, on the other side of the bitumen, they found impressions and, in some cases, the actual remnants of barnacles.

Any self-respecting seafarer knows that barnacles will attach themselves to a hull submerged in water for any length of time, so if we combine that knowledge with the fact that a row of reeds was affixed to the other side of this viscous, tar-like, waterproof substance called bitumen; well, perhaps you begin to get the idea of what these finds signify. In short, these artifacts from as-Sabiyah are the best items found to present direct evidence of bitumen-coated reeds that were submerged in water, a tantalizing indicator that these may be the only surviving pieces from a Mesopotamian reed-boat.[^15]

---
# bitumen as an indicator of movement

I say they may be the “only” surviving pieces, but it is also possible that similar artifacts from a separate site are more evidence of Mesopotamian reed-boats. This second site is called Ra’s al-Jinz and it is located in modern-day Oman, which puts it still on the Persian Gulf but well farther south than as-Sabiyah. The evidence from Ra’s al-Jinz comes in the same form, bitumen chunks impressed with reeds and barnacles, but the dating for this site is almost 3,000 years after the dating for as-Sabiyah.

This much later archaeological site tells us that the people in the area still used bitumen to coat their boats even in the heart of the Bronze Age. These boats would still likely have been made of reeds, but as time progressed, the technology also progressed. We’ll come to see in future episodes how plank-built vessels become more predominant, and it is possible that they were used at Ra’s al-Jinz as well. There are numerous other sites scattered all along the western coast of the Perisian Gulf that contain similar artifacts, dated at various points in the range of time[^16], so the reality is that bitumen was used to coat reed boats back in the Ubaid period and then continually all the way through the historical sources we saw moments ago, all the way up to today as Thesiger witnessed.

If we compare the various sites we have talked about, but as-Sabiyah and Ra’s al-Jinz in particular, they illustrate an interesting progression, similar to the one we saw with the volcanic rock obsidian in the last episode. Analysis of the bitumen from these two Persian Gulf site shows that the artifact from as-Sabiyah, dated to roughly 5,000 BCE, was made from a tar seep that is located in Burgan, a site in Kuwait and south of as-Sabiyah itself. The raw material must have been transported a fair distance to where it was ultimately used, then.

The bitumen from Ra’s al-Jinz though, was taken from a tar seep in northern Iraq, a much more substantial distance from origin to end-point. Of course, several millennia separate the artifacts at these two sites, but we can still conclude that trade networks gradually grew and became more complex as ancient people on the Persian Gulf and in the areas around it expanded their trade networks and began to establish societal structures.

If we focus back on the Ubaid period and the ensuring years, some intriguing theories come into focus. We will see the growth of networks later on as we continue to examine the maritime history of the Mediterranean and beyond, but back in the Ubaid period, what exactly would have spurred these people to leave their growing settlements and farming cultures and venture onto the Persian Gulf in tar-sealed reed boats?

One theory supposes that pearls are what motivated more movement amongst the prehistoric Mesopotamians. The theory goes that there were unique cultures that existed in the various regions that bordered the Persian Gulf, and while they seem to have had separate origins, the presence of pearls at these sites could be the link that demonstrates a motivation to travel and trade.[^17]

To bring it back to our Ubaid site at as-Sabiyah, they have also found a pearl that was pierced and likely used as jewelry. The presence of both pearls and pearl-oysters at a number of other Ubaid sites does present an intriguing new element into our search to discover why Ubaid-period Mesopotamians would have been motivated to travel around the gulf.[^18] It’s also entirely possible that other resources like fish or bitumen were the motivation for ancient people to push the boundary of their world, but all archaeologists can work with are the substances that still remain for us to find today. Pottery is prime among the artifacts that we can still discovery today, and Ubaid-period pottery is chief among the artifacts that ties various sites to that culture and helps us trace where they were and how they may have spread and traveled.[^19]

# movement increases, trade drives societal growth

Now, in the episode today we have largely followed the Ubaid people, an early culture rooted in Mesopotamia but which then expanded to sections of the Persian Gulf. They are a great focal point to help trace the progression of societal growth in that region, but as time marched on, things began to grow more complex, both around Mesopotamia and in other locales. We need to try and tackle some of the growing complexity at this point. Since it involves many regions that begin to connect and influence each other, our next episode will take us a bit further south, to Egypt.

Just as we’ve seen today in Mesopotamia, early humans in Egypt clustered around a key source of water, and they left behind plenty of evidence to help illuminate their relationship with the water, how they perceived it and how they used it.

# Conclusion

In due time we will have enough groundwork laid to then compare and contrast the fortunes of Mesopotamia in their quest for natural resources against Egypt’s quest for the same. The two regions and civilizations viewed one against the other can give us a rather illuminating view into the ancient world and its trade. And while they were two of the main early players, we’ve barely yet touched on the Mediterranean as the Bronze Age began to unfold. Plenty ahead for us yet.
