Ahoy crew! This hidden corner of the website is an outlet where my ongoing research, notes, writing, and thoughts are accessible to you all. Below you will find links to the books and journal articles that make up the source material for the podcast.

In the left sidebar, all links are available in one folder or another. You can find individual sources, landings for sources by type, and more.

Dive in to a particular book to see the passages that I've highlighted, or read episode transcripts where all sources appear as hyperlinks. Hovering over these will pop up the passage the supports the statement, along with any citation info and (potentially) related sources and passages.

The app that feeds this info is where I do all research and writing, so it will be constantly updated with (roughly) real-time insight into what I am researching and writing currently.

Thanks for your continued support and listenership!
