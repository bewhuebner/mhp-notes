“The extent and wealth of the land of Meluhha were on a different scale alto- gether. Stretching along the Indus River, this civilization, which fl ourished from around 2600 BCE, was on a par, in terms of its sophistication, with those of Mesopotamia and Egypt at the same time. In fact, the land of Meluhha was much more extensive than either—it stretched over double the area of either Mesopotamia or Egypt—and the well-planned cities were grand and orderly.48” (Podany, 2012, p. 47)
